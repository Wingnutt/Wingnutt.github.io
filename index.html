It is time for mankind to climb above capitalism and similar survival competing. It is time to outlaw ownership, billing, money, and ALL demanding.  It is time to re-activate caring.  It is quite simple and obvious!  Religions promote giving/love, and capitalism promotes taking/fear.  WAKE UP!  LET'S FIX THIS!  We will need gardeners, as we QUIT killing animals and QUIT cropping plants.  We must wait for the food to "fall" as the season's name tells us.  Hey Free-Marketeers... are you 'up' for a little gardening?  You'll LOVE doing plant-care and fall-net work in one of New America's 500,000 orchards and groves!  It'll be fun, considering in an all-love world, live bands, carnivals, picnics, and accidentally falling-into MANY hidden love-things... is common.  ALL project areas (workplaces) will look like carnivals, and their all-volunteer project-force will celebrate their production of TOP NOTCH QUALITY things!  After all, folks who do hard work, on great survival tools, out of love for mankind... are national heros in New America, and followed HEAVILY by the media cameras and mentor-seeking children.  Ready to throw the switch?
