<p>Ok, welcome to <strong>The Wingnut Chronicles</strong>‚Ä¶ the

whims and wishes, no matter how embarrassing or noob you might sound.</p>
<p>Rattle-on about anything‚Ä¶ maybe someone will join-in, and perhaps
(likely) your 3D hopes and dreams will inspire others.  The world of 3D
is wide-open, and we have <a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">THE BEST</a> webGL library ANYWHERE.  We also have a great community of helpers and super-hero techies.</p>

        <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/deltakosh">@Deltakosh</a>,
 you‚Äôre always so kind to me‚Ä¶ thank you!  Working near you and your
marvelous inventions‚Ä¶ has been a complete pleasure, and an excellent
learning experience.  I hope it continues for many more years.</p>
<p>Ok, so, let‚Äôs talk busyness.  Did ya‚Äôll see the keyboard shortcuts?  When not editing, just type a question mark.</p>
<p>There is also a choice for displaying hot keys‚Ä¶ in the ‚Äú<a href="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/media/images/81200000/jpg/_81200761_hamburger-icon.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener">hamburger</a>‚Äù menu.</p>
<p>Discourse text-wrangling appears to be based on ‚Äú<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" rel="nofollow noopener">Markdown</a>‚Äù‚Ä¶
 which is also used in our documentation system.  How nice is THAT, eh?
 Users who have never contributed to our documentation‚Ä¶ due to fears of
learning GitHub Markdown‚Ä¶ can now play with Markdown a little bit every
day‚Ä¶ in their forum posts.  Later, they will feel quite comfortable
contributing to BabylonJS documentation and playground-based tutorials.</p>
<p>It will take some time and patience.  For example‚Ä¶ the hamburger link
 above‚Ä¶ is a link to an image.  I struggled to make it be a LINK, and
not import/embed the image into post.  I sort-of ‚Äúmanually‚Äù built the
link. <code>[some words](url/someImage.jpg)</code>.  Still learning.</p>
<p>Open source!  Discourse is OPEN SOURCE!  That means‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre free to
fly.  We can modify our forum‚Ä¶ TONS, if we wish.  That‚Ä¶ is pretty sweet.</p>
<p>So far, I sort-of like the new joint!  I think we can get some work
(and play) done‚Ä¶ 'round here.  Let‚Äôs try to make sure that we have
cleaned-up any loose-ends on the old forum.  Helpers, if you have open
issues, try not to let they or their issues‚Ä¶ get neglected.   This is a
time of volatility, so a little extra effort‚Ä¶ would be nice.</p>
<p>Control-z/undo, and add-link-&gt;fill URL field with url.jpg-&gt;CANCEL‚Ä¶ needs a little investigation.</p>
<p>When trying to add the Hamburger link to the image‚Ä¶ I saw that it had
 mistakenly ‚Äúembeded‚Äù the image into the post.  I pushed ‚Äúcancel‚Äù on the
 make-link popup panel.  That CANCEL did not undo the image embed.  So I
 tried control-z to undo it.  That failed, too.  I needed to highlight
&amp; cut the Markdown debris from the post.  After that, I built the
link manually.</p>
<p>Okay, what should we try to break?  Anyone got any diagrams of how
this system is ‚Äúassembled‚Äù?  Is there some kind of config file‚Ä¶ just for
 us?  How about an ‚Äúadd-on modules‚Äù folder‚Ä¶ just for us?  Who has ‚Äúthe
goods‚Äù on how to hack this puppy?  Let‚Äôs write a simple ‚Äúmod‚Äù to the
forum‚Ä¶ just to prove that we can.  Anyone know how?  Will you teach us?
 (thx).</p>
<p>Ahh, here it is.  <a href="https://docs.discourse.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://docs.discourse.org/</a>  There‚Äôs the ‚Äúmeat and potatoes‚Äù.  Yum!</p>

        <p>Coooooool.</p>
<p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/deltakosh">@Deltakosh</a>‚Ä¶ did you add that link-icon to docs‚Ä¶ in upper right corner?  That‚Äôs NICE.  Thx!</p>
<p>How many icons can we put there?  Know?  Anything goes?</p>
<p>When we get a fresh upgrade of the forum software, will things be over-written?  Probably easily avoided.</p>
<p>Anyway, I would like to see link-icons for main website, playground, github source repo, and possibly‚Ä¶ github DOCS repo.</p>
<p>Too cluttered?  Any icons you choose/draw‚Ä¶ fine with me.  Header is always black-background, no matter the theme (so far).  <img src="twc8_e2_files/wink_002.png" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  SO, only one icon color needed, so far.</p>
<p>Perhaps keep lots of space between each icon, so the icon-bar works nice on mobiles‚Ä¶ for fat-finger/thumb presses.</p>
<p>Sort of an SVG festival up there, eh?  Live-generated?  Icon
generator can check whether light or dark theme, and draw icons (and
header backgroundColor) in different colors/shapes‚Ä¶ on-the-fly?    Wow!</p>
<p>Maybe we should leave the header colors alone, for now, eh?  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Ahh‚Ä¶ HTML for GUI‚Ä¶ so goooood. Our forum becomes an extension of our playground app.</p>
<p><code>&lt;iframe id="two" width="100" height="100" frameborder="3"
scrolling="no" src="http://playground.babylonjs.com"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></p>
<p>I tried to embed a playground in a post, as we can see.  Fun!  Domain
 needs white-listing, I think.  I got an empty, bordered box-model.
But, possibilities are numerous.</p>

        <p>Hi Naz!  And Hi Gryff, long time no see.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/gryff">@gryff</a>‚Ä¶ Not so much change, really. Forum decor and core bloat, mostly.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
  Everyone is a bit wobbly from the move, and we‚Äôre still painting and
hanging pictures, but, everyone still has that ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try to help‚Äù
attitude.  I still try comedy and fail most of the time.   We sure miss
YOU, though, <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/gryff">@gryff</a> ‚Ä¶ but it seemed that you became THE Blender expert (user side)‚Ä¶ and that probably got old, eh?</p>
<p>We‚Äôre all still learning BJS, and 3D terminology/practices, and the
new forum, and JS, and Math.  We‚Äôre also learning the art of being
kind/tactful/social in a high-intensity, drama-queening, somewhat
angry-feeling real-world.  That‚Äôs quite a pile on our plates.  It seems
we‚Äôre all on the edge of insanity, to some degree.</p>
<p>Me, I‚Äôm all about the feeling of empowerment and accomplishment that
comes with using BJS/webGL, and the societal smiles which result.  WebGL
 art crosses international borders BEAUTIFULLY, and I love that.  That
brings happiness and further playful curiosity (making adults become
happy, playful kids, again).</p>

Congrats on grandchild #2, G-man!  I hope life is going ok for you.

A Wingnut Chronicles tradition... is to show cool playgrounds that are
found with my playground detector... usually found at Lake Babylon's
"Playground Park".  So, here we go... a fantastic "micro" playground
from @bghgary :  https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#H4S8FE#0  Sweet!
 Should we (try-to) remove its animation and physics-it-up?  Power it
with applyForce and applyImpulse and joints and motors?  (omg!)
<hr>
PS: Gryff... you can click on your picture icon, then click the "gear"
in the upper right.  Lots of "personal profile" settings to tweak.
Party on!

        <p>Hi gang.  Here‚Äôs some Wingnut yapping about ‚Äúsmart paths‚Äù or something similar.  It is a branch from <a href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/how-to-implement-path-deformation-in-babylonjs/138/38">this thread</a>.</p>
<p>Think about a flying camera path/trajectory.  There needs to be more
than camera positioning along the path.  The camera likely needs to
aim-at various things as it travels the path.  (Easing into/out-of
camera.targets).  The camera could bank, pitch, and yaw‚Ä¶ like an
airplane, both during path-turns AND during straight-runs.  These things
 sometimes/often need easing.</p>
<p>And FOV might need to change along the way, and easing on THAT would be good, too.  (same as scale for a path-following mesh)</p>
<p>Then path-travel speed, too.  Watch a crop-dusting airplane.  At the end of a run across the field, the aircraft does what?  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandelle" rel="nofollow noopener">chandelle</a>?
  I think this would require that the path points EASE-into/out-of
getting closer-together and further-apart (from each other).  Short
point-to-point ‚Äúpoint-spans‚Äù would be needed to make a smooth, tight
corner.  But on longer, straight runs, 2-3 points spaced far-apart‚Ä¶ is
fine‚Ä¶ if the throttle is set correctly.  Basing the throttle on ‚Äúpoints
per second‚Äù is probably not a good idea, or maybe a user-select-able
‚Äúoption‚Äù.</p>
<p>For roller coasters, inertia and gravity cause the speed changes
along the path, but with our physics-less mesh/camera paths, we might
not have physics available.  Thus, we need to accelerate and brake the
speeds along the path‚Ä¶ and they need to be eased.  Ideally, the path
itself carries the throttle information‚Ä¶ somehow.  The path itself
becomes an actionManager/event-generator and uses observers, possibly
intersect-with-infoNode related.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/dizzy_face.png" title=":dizzy_face:" class="emoji" alt=":dizzy_face:">  Similar to railroad track sensors.</p>
<p>Recently, I questioned WHICH classes should be allowed to have
metadata properties.  This situation‚Ä¶ is related because, we might need
Vector3‚Äôs with metadata.  Smart V3‚Äôs, which not only carry their
location, but also info for the vehicle which traverses the path.  Much
like info-nodes buried in roadways‚Ä¶ that cars can read as they pass
them.  Likely, we would make a special class for these smart
path-points, if indeed this system would work at all.</p>
<p>Would we decrease path-travel speeds‚Ä¶ by placing the path points
closer together?  Or would that be done with throttle values gotten from
 along-the-path info nodes?  OR, at certain delta-times of the flight?</p>
<p>Continuing with this thought, it seems like these paths need two
kinds of points.  One kind‚Ä¶ to plot the path thru space.  Another kind
for giving rotation, scaling, easing, and throttle settings‚Ä¶ to the
object traveling the  path.</p>
<p>Manually flying a little airplane such as our crop duster‚Ä¶ gives nice
 pathing, easing, banking, and throttling.  Asking a path-editor/math
formulas‚Ä¶ to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù (derive) a similar path-plot and along-path-actions‚Ä¶
 seems a nightmare.</p>
<p>I think we need ‚Äúnormals‚Äù along the path, and that means that the path‚Ä¶ might ACTUALLY be a BJS Ribbon.</p>
<p>Not sure.  Wingnut babbling.  <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1HH4OJ#14" rel="nofollow noopener">Roller coaster</a>
 climbing turns and crop-duster chandelles‚Ä¶ ease the vehicle into a
near-stop/stall, speed-wise.  It seems‚Ä¶ the path-plotting thru
worldSpace‚Ä¶ is ONE thing, and info-nodes ALONG that path‚Ä¶ that the
vehicle ‚Äúreads‚Äù along the way‚Ä¶ is ANOTHER thing.  hmm.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1HH4OJ#15" rel="nofollow noopener">another version of the roller-coaster</a>‚Ä¶
 without attached camera.  Imagine a sentence traveling that rail, much
slower, among the bushes of a wooded VR/3D park, where young kids (their
 avatars) sit (hover) and learn to read.  The sentences, words, and
letters‚Ä¶ can become alive‚Ä¶ hopping, spinning, dancing, bumping into
one-another, such a happy learn-to-read environment‚Ä¶ or even a nice
environment for reading the latest headlines.  Yum!</p>
<p>Speaking of dancing fonts‚Ä¶</p>

        <p>Hi D.  I think it is <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/jerome">@jerome</a>‚Äôs
 roller-coaster playground‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt understand the math (much),
either.  That is why we (I) talk, here.  Perhaps we invent an easier
way.  Perhaps not.</p>
<p>I think‚Ä¶ to be good path-tool inventors, we MUST learn Jerome‚Äôs methods.</p>
<p>I think that the roller-coaster demo is currently at maximum-easy‚Ä¶ per the tools/inventions we now have.</p>
<p>Flight-paths are important to the future of 3D (camera and/or
spacecraft auto-pilot/auto-landers).  We will likely (hopefully)
continue studying and testing more methods/spline-editors.</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest!  You ask a good question‚Ä¶ with no answer, yet.</p>

so far but i was wondering cuz i have plenty of ideas,‚Ä¶ but i usually
follow the forum posts cuz i like learning all the basics.<br>

        <p>Hi G.  Yeah, there are plenty of ‚Äúbadges‚Äù, eh?  Just like the
 Boy Scouts.  I got my ‚Äústarting a forum fire by rubbing two sticks
together‚Äù -badge‚Ä¶ just last week.  I‚Äôm SO proud.  heh.</p>
<p>Gryff:  ‚Äúmy fridge door is not that big‚Äù  hahah.  You‚Äôre SO friggin‚Äô
funny!!!  Do these youngsters even KNOW about decorative fridge magnets
and the ego significance of macaroni art and coloring book pages?  i
doubt it.  Yep, that‚Äôs back when earn‚Äôn‚Äôdeserve systems didn‚Äôt cause so
many societal inequality problems.</p>
<p>Notice that there are TWO reply buttons beneath each post.  One is a
POST reply, and the other‚Ä¶ a TOPIC reply.  At first, I thought there was
 a separate notification‚Ä¶ for when YOUR POST was replied-to, even if you
 didn‚Äôt start the topic.  But under further investigation, that seems to
 be untrue.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs based-upon if your post was LIKED, instead.  Perhaps there is
two layers of ‚Äútrack‚Äù.  ONE where you track all posts to a topic, and
the other where you track ONLY replies to YOUR POSTS‚Ä¶ within a topic
(directed replies - directed at you).</p>
<p>I‚Äôm still learning.  There‚Äôs bound to be some momentary pain when
learning new things.  And, it‚Äôs easy for old people like me‚Ä¶ to become
‚Äúcrotchety‚Äù, you know.  I suppose it comes-from too many years of
us-them wars.  We get ‚Äúfried‚Äù.</p>
<p>I deleted a big long post here‚Ä¶ ‚Äútoward‚Äù you, as you likely know.
You got to read it before I deleted it (I saw your LIKE on it).  The
topic felt a little personal, and there weren‚Äôt any comments to/about
it‚Ä¶ rolling-in.  (just some Wingnut yammering).  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I was ‚Äúfried‚Äù on the Invision (old forum) editor.  Other than the colors, it was reasonably annoying.  But it DID let me type <code>*sigh*</code> easier than THIS editor does.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I like the text editor here‚Ä¶ better than Invision‚Äôs (old forum).  The
 old one had cursor-key failures and needed shifted-returns to get
single CRLF‚Äôs.  Easier to make a post look pretty, here, EXCEPT‚Ä¶ no text
 colors allowed in the Discourse editor.  Allowing colored text would
likely screw-with the light/dark themes‚Ä¶ allowing users to accidentally
make some text‚Ä¶ invisible, in certain themes/styles.</p>
<hr>
<p>I really like the allowing-of SOME html‚Ä¶ inside a post.  I find <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> pretty handy, as ANY long-poster would.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
  But there are some slow-to-learn rules about ‚Äúinsert a blank line
before‚Äù and ‚Äúon a line of its own‚Äù that apply to using HTML, Markdown,
and BBcode in posts.  I haven‚Äôt learned the fine details, yet.  Those
rules have likely ‚Äòmigrated-in‚Äô from rules of Markdown and BBcode‚Ä¶ two
editor-allowed formats.</p>
<p>I wonder if I/we need a new docs webpage/markdown-markup.  Perhaps‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúDiscourse Tutorial for Crotchety Old Geezers‚Äù?  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  We really don‚Äôt teach any Discourse features, we just bitch about them (and about youngsters with zero horse-sense).  heh.</p>
<p>(Wingy oils-up the hinges on his ‚Äúgeezer vent‚Äù, making sure it is ready for purse-dumping and drama-queening ops).  <img src="twc8_e2_files/smiley.png" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Funny Wingy, I just spent the day with my two year old grand daughter and I showed her <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/abhivaidya">@abhivaidya</a> 's <a href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/its-christmas/428">Christmas scene</a>.
 We had a great time as she danced with Santa and pointed at the
snowflakes. Later in the day, she insisted on seeing it again. Now she
is a real youngster - and had a really great time. See my new comment on
 that thread.</p>
<p>It took me back to my days of VRML when I received an email from a
lady in Hawaii about the fun her daughter had had with a ‚Äúdress up doll‚Äù
 piece of VRML  that I had created.</p>
<p>With 3D, perhaps it is all in the ‚Äúeye of the beholder‚Äù - and young folk see it with a different eye <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>But then being ‚Äúcrotchety‚Äù is what old folks like me are supposed to be <img src="twc8_e2_files/open_mouth.png" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"><img src="twc8_e2_files/smile.png" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p><a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/gryff">@gryff</a> - Know that I wasn‚Äôt implying that <strong>you</strong> are crotchety.  But I know that I CAN BE SO, at times.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Yep, it‚Äôs our (my) job, these days. <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It is easy to ‚Äúget caught-up‚Äù in the happiness of children, and to feel the same happiness.  (happiness is ‚Äòinfectious‚Äô).</p>
<p>This can also happen worldwide, with adults‚Ä¶ as soon as we quit
competing.  It would help if we eliminated ALL borders/fences/walls,
too.  Just look at a picture of Earth, from space-view.  It is easy to
‚Äúfeel‚Äù that we are ALL members of the same family‚Ä¶ called‚Ä¶ The
Earthlings.</p>
<p>Story:  Once upon a time, I noticed that MY feelings toward life‚Ä¶
CHANGED‚Ä¶ whenever I saw another person‚Ä¶ having fun, feeling good, and/or
 celebrating.  I think that‚Äôs why the TV show Candid Camera was a
success.</p>
<p>I did some further experiments, after I saw a motorist driving on a
highway‚Ä¶ going ‚Äúrhythm-crazy‚Äù (nearly dance-driving) because of the
music he was listening-to.  This ‚Äúparty animal‚Äù had his head rocking
side-to-side, to the beat of the music‚Ä¶ as he drove.  It made me want to
 join him, and ask how/why he became so happy.</p>
<p>Now, I experiment often‚Ä¶ with violently-rocking my head side-to-side
(easy to see head silhouette from a distance)‚Ä¶ while I drive and sing or
 listen to the radio‚Ä¶ on the road.  I travel a bit slower than the speed
 limit, so I get passed by people who have been following‚Ä¶ watching my
head rock and steering-wheel drumming.</p>
<p>They ALWAYS look at me, smiling, as they pass.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
  They get ‚Äúcaught-up‚Äù in my party-animal gestures.  It is darned fun,
but it hurts my neck after a while.  I‚Äôm thinking about inventing a
passenger-side artificial super-model robot‚Ä¶ with lots of super-model
hair to shake.  Simulated Car-Riding Party-Animal Girlfriend‚Ä¶ version
1.0.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I went-on to do more experiments and do more observations.  i
heavily-observed sports‚Ä¶ noticing WHEN/NOT teams celebrated each others‚Äô
 victories, or helped an opposing player stand-up, after falling‚Ä¶ things
 like that.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs lots to be learned‚Ä¶ about sharing (and sharing credit-for)
happiness/great-moments/successes.  When stress stays low, our forum
members and fans get-caught-up in the fun of BJS and its creations.
Sometimes, BJS stress is high‚Ä¶ when users are trying to use BJS to ‚Äúmake
 a living‚Äù.  Sometimes, these folks are hurried and demanding, which is
understandable, but still unfortunate.</p>
<p>Lately, it seems that The Earthlings are indeed ‚Äúgetting caught-up‚Äù
in the emotions of others, but those emotions are rarely happiness‚Ä¶
unless your favorite sports team was victorious and totally destroyed
the enemy.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/confused.png" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:">  (blood-lust / blood-sport)</p>
<p>Enough philosophy, eh?  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
  Ok, I‚Äôll bring it back on-topic.  Umm‚Ä¶ I wonder if the Earth uses
Euler rotation or Quaternion rotation.  hmm.   heh.   How‚Äôs that?</p>

<p>For those who are confused, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=Hattori+Hanz%C5%8D+sword" rel="nofollow noopener">HH sword</a>.</p>
<p>Very sharp metal.  Maybe safer to set pivotPoint on TIP of sword, and hit things with handle/hilt.</p>
<p>Just bruises, no blood.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/nasimiasl">@nasimiasl</a>‚Ä¶ will you use a NEW TYPE of ‚Äúsmart path‚Äù (like the roller coaster path)‚Ä¶ for the fancy sword actions (sword paths)?</p>

        <p>Nice stuff, Naz!  Unreal.</p>
<p>Ok, back to aimless Wingnut yammering for a moment.</p>
<p>Did something happen with JS ‚Äúcollections‚Äù, recently?  I have seen
the ‚Äúcollections‚Äù term pop-up in some github source comments, and I saw <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/jcpalmer">@JCPalmer</a> say ‚ÄúLayers to Collections (tabled)‚Äù in another post (which sounded very ‚Äúmodular‚Äù to me, and made my left nipple erect).  <img src="twc8_e2_files/open_mouth.png" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"></p>
<p>Do we have JS Collections, these days?  Who knows ‚Äúthe scoop‚Äù?</p>
<p>Aren‚Äôt ya glad that they/we didn‚Äôt use the old ‚ÄúVector‚Äù term, instead
 of ‚ÄúCollection‚Äù?  We, here in 3D land‚Ä¶ have PLENTY of ‚Äúvector‚Äù
terminology to deal-with, already.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/smiley.png" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

        <p>Hi gang.  On a different subject, I learned that cones with
bottom diameter of 0‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt light their bottoms‚Ä¶ with
hemisphericLight.groundColor settings.</p>

<p>(toggle lines 15/16)</p>
<p>I‚Äôm thinking it should be an adjustment to the light, not an adjustment to the cylinder/cone mesh.  (if possible)</p>
<p>Should we think about an epsilon value (micro-value), somewhere?   Thoughts, anyone?</p>

(<a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#51" rel="nofollow noopener">#51 for a wider view</a>)</p>
<p>Kind of smooth and nice.  Perhaps could use some lens flares.</p>
<p>Box (which you can‚Äôt see in PG <span class="hashtag">#53</span>
because camera is sitting atop it) does not tilt up/down when traveling
up/down hills, yet.  It doesn‚Äôt steer-down path very well anymore,
either.  (not as well as snippet car)</p>
<p>Just goofin‚Äô around, as usual.  I love the smoothness of this path generation math.</p>
<p>Later, I‚Äôll re-flatten the path, bring-up the speeds again (reduce
points)‚Ä¶ and hang a physics joint beneath the ‚ÄúcarBody‚Äù.  Then attach a
mesh and camera to the bottom of that joint.  (pendulum)</p>
<p>With just the right speed, gravity, mass, and joint axis length, we should see some camera ‚Äú<a href="https://www.bolliger-mabillard.com/sites/default/files/inverted1996_montu01.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener">banking</a>‚Äù on the corners.  Bobsled-track-ish.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/face_with_raised_eyebrow.png" title=":face_with_raised_eyebrow:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_raised_eyebrow:"></p>

        <p>Hi gang!</p>
<p>Weird forum-software subject:   Has anyone noticed that‚Ä¶ when you
edit one of your previous forum posts, the forum lists that post at the
TOP of its ‚Äúlatest posts in this sub-forum‚Äù list?</p>
<p>In other words, when you edit a post, it bumps it to the top of the list.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know if this is good/wanted.  Hey Discourse experts‚Ä¶ is this adjustable?  Know?  If so, should we?</p>
<p>I edit quite a few posts‚Ä¶ sometimes WEEKS after first-posting them.  I
 don‚Äôt want folks to re-read the post after the minor edit (because it
went to the top of the ‚Äúlatest posts‚Äù list).</p>
<p>Sometimes, I simply fix the spelling on one word.  Then it looks like a NEW POST to other readers.</p>
<p>Thoughts, anyone?  thx.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>  I learned that moderators can use the ‚Äúreset
 bump date‚Äù option‚Ä¶ to keep an edited post from jumping to the top of
the forum lists.  hmm.  Interesting.</p>

        <p>HI wingnut‚Ä¶<br>
hi wingnut‚Ä¶<br>
I was thinking to start a new language apart from js‚Ä¶<br>
so my choices is btw Java to android and c# in unity‚Ä¶<br>
Idk what to pick both seems like not fun to learn c# has 100 different types and<br>
java idk.<br>
but i dont want to be limited by only javascript what languages do u do?<br>
I looked at ur ‚Äúsimple‚Äù path 3d also it looks cool but i dont understand the math is the sinus making<br>
the points end and start to connect into a forever loop?</p>

        <p>Hi drogs!</p>
<p>I like JS better than anything‚Ä¶ but it has some limits.  Only a few of those limits‚Ä¶ block me from things.</p>
<p>I have done SOME Java, some 6510 assembly (C-64), some REXX, and much
 LambdaCore MOO code, whatever that is called.  My suggestion to you‚Ä¶
perhaps Python.  It seems to have WIDE support and popularity.</p>
<hr>
On the path-math, yeah, I agree... I have not studied it well.  I have barely begun experimenting with that.
<p>To move toward ‚Äúsmart-path‚Äù‚Ä¶ perhaps each point in the path‚Ä¶ needs a
transformNode added‚Ä¶ to cause each path-point‚Ä¶ to have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and a
transformation.  As the camera moves-along the path‚Ä¶ it also ANIMATES
its rotation‚Ä¶ from currentPathPointTransform‚Ä¶ to nextPathPointTransform.</p>
<p>This will cause the camera to turn-toward various targets, or bank
like an airplane when going around corners, etc.  Other motion might be
possible, too‚Ä¶ IF we put SOME ‚Äúdata‚Äù (other than position) in the
path-points.</p>
<p>Smart path-points.  For now, we can overload the vector3-class
path-points‚Ä¶ by simply adding a point.transformNode = new
BABYLON.TransformNode() to each path-point.</p>
<p>How to SET all the pathPoint.transformNode values‚Ä¶ to create
nicely-eased camera target-turns (without camera.lockedTarget) and
banking on corners‚Ä¶ I have NO IDEA.  heh.  Still thinking.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Thoughts?</p>

        <p>haha‚Ä¶ me and my thoughts‚Ä¶ yeah maybe a for loop to add data to every ‚Äúpoint‚Äù<br>
everypoint just represent a point an camera angle‚Ä¶<br>
you dont even have to use the same array of points as long as they
contain the same number of points and time pass btw points‚Ä¶ but im not
an expert wingnut.<br>
and change camera angle in quaternion or radians watever float the boat‚Ä¶
 in registerbefore render loop somehow. so when point[100] camera
animation change to that but idk its probably not working but if its an
animation loop‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Im not advanced yet‚Ä¶ but i always try keep it simple.<br>
And i love javascript too‚Ä¶ its my first language I just read about android games.<br>
and there is two possibilities to go with android studio and java<br>
or unity c# to natively export to android‚Ä¶<br>
but I dont know i have tons of fun with babylonjs‚Ä¶<br>
it just lacks a bit of jobs opportunities and i guess i need be more well rounded =)</p>

        <p>Yeah, your ‚Äúpoint‚Äù is well-taken.  The smart-path is very near-to standard camera animation techniques.</p>
<p>hmm.  Animation interpolations are quite similar to our path-math.</p>
<p>Programming as a job?  Blech.  That would ruin the fun, imho.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I‚Äôm retired now, but my career of selling weed to children‚Ä¶ rarely bothered my programming fun.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  (just kidding, of course).</p>
<p>If I were young again, I think I would design/build a custom
graffiti-removal truck (20 year bank note), computerized‚Ä¶ water-jet,
chem-jet, sand-blast on a long boom‚Ä¶ cameras‚Ä¶ all work done in comfort
of truck cab, and often quite automated.  Plenty of time to code games

<p>Of course, the truck and its robotic arm‚Ä¶ freely run JS, and its cameras use BJS-based Augmented Reality. <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

That‚Äôs irrelevant.  The first nice-working version‚Ä¶ is <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#AMYR5C#14" rel="nofollow noopener">this #14 PG</a>.
  It got a bunch of engine.onResizeObservable additions from a forum
friend/helper, and now it does quite well when canvas size changes.  I
like it.</p>
<p>I went-on to do more torturing in <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#AMYR5C#15" rel="nofollow noopener">pg #15</a>‚Ä¶
 sliding-around the advancedDynamicTexture (master/root full-screen GUI
container), to see how well my diagram held-up.  Pretty ugly.</p>
<p>I needed to clean-up my hard-coded positions, and use more ‚Äúderived‚Äù positions. <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#AMYR5C#16" rel="nofollow noopener">Pg #16</a> does a pretty good job‚Ä¶ except for ‚Äòtarget‚Äô.</p>
<p>Target‚Ä¶ is a little ellipse defined at line 55.  It hangs-out at the
intersection of Eastwest Blvd, and Northsouth Av.  It‚Ä¶ is still having
problems with its position during the slides.  Help/ideas welcome,
there.</p>
<hr>
<p>On a completely different subject (except for the similarities), I
was thinking about grids of grids‚Ä¶ of grids‚Ä¶ of grids‚Ä¶ the making of
HIGHLY DETAILED dashboards/control-panels.  We‚Äôre talking tiny LED
indicator lights and micro switches, and readouts, and little radar
view, and little infrared view, and knobs, and widgets, and labels, and
doohickies‚Ä¶ till ya vomit!  Something that just COULD NEVER EVER be
operated on a mobile device‚Ä¶ at least not without a needle-like stylus.
 <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I‚Äôm thinkin‚Äô ‚Ä¶ 200 controls on a half-screen-height dashboard (some
controls are little LED‚Äôs that only change color and don‚Äôt need
clicking/sliding.)  All within grids of grids of grids.  Would a guy
need a manager?  Could we get syntax such as‚Ä¶
adt.radar.range.sensitivity.autoswitch = true?  Kind of ‚ÄúFluent‚Äù-ish?  I
 dunno‚Ä¶ I barely know what <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-like-boss-understanding-fluent-apis/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fluent</a> is about.</p>
<p>Could a ‚Äúmanager‚Äù assist us ‚Äúdashmasters‚Äù with building custom
observers that ‚Äúbind‚Äù switch.value‚Ä¶ to its switch.indicatorLight.value?
 Sort of a ‚Äúback side of the panel‚Äù binding/patching?  A special kind of
 notifyListeners‚Ä¶ super easy to patch-together‚Ä¶ thanks to the manager‚Äôs
‚Äúpatch panel‚Äù?  Wow!  Perhaps not apropos, because switch needs an
onChange handler ANYWAY.  Just toggle its indicator light‚Ä¶ within there.
  I suppose the indicator light could be a member of the switch‚Äôs
onChange notifyList. Sounds sane and logical.</p>
<p>Complex Grid Manager v.01  hmm.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
  Who will invent the manager that creates our first ever complex
dashboard-o-micro-controls?  C‚Äômon, ya KNOW ya want to build it.  I
think <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/deltakosh">@Deltakosh</a>? still holds the record for most controls on a single adt‚Ä¶ <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#WZZDNR#7" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#WZZDNR#7</a></p>
<p>Lookups might matter‚Ä¶ but maybe we have an ADT.getControlByName() feature‚Ä¶ already active.</p>
<p>What if‚Ä¶ the grid/cells can stretch beyond idealWidth and
idealHeight‚Ä¶ but the controls within the grid-cells‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt stretch.
hmm.  Rough area of town.  Rubbery canvas size‚Ä¶ sucks, eh?  It makes a
person wonder if .thickness can accept micro-percentages (so borders get
 thinner/thicker with scalings).</p>
<p>What‚Äôs that?  It didn‚Äôt make you wonder about that‚Ä¶ at all?  uhn.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Ok, that‚Äôs enough Wingnut blabbering for now.   Party on!   Stay orthoganous to your tobogganous!</p>

 seeing that YOU caused the 3 unnecessary posts to The Wingnut

I think he is.  I‚Äôm guessing‚Ä¶ 125.   <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>C‚Äômon Rah‚Ä¶ hurry-up with that JS one-liner or however you decide‚Ä¶ to
get us a total count on how many controls were used.  I‚Äôm hungry‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs

<p>How many?

<p>-18 F here this morn, and i really need to do some snow-blowing.
brrrr.  Does anyone think my 25 year old Toro snowblower will
start/operate in these temps?  What about Wingnut‚Äôs body?  Can he handle
 45 mins in his spacewalker‚Äôs suit, to get the job done?  What will

<p>I‚Äôm scared. Someone HOLD me! <img src="twc8_e2_files/roll_eyes.png" title=":roll_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":roll_eyes:"></p>
<p>Update:  After warming the starter rope pulley for 15 mins with a
pistol-style hair dryer, the Toro started 1st pull, and kicked butt on
the neighborhood snowdrifts and street-plow banks!  And I didn‚Äôt get
frostbite, or frosted bytes.  yay!  My cross-street neighbor FINALLY got
 his Ariens-brand blower started, but it needed to be zapped with the

        <p>Hi TL!  Glad to do it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#XWVXN9#76" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#XWVXN9#76</a></p>
<p>Brightness:<br>
Line 120 refTexture.level can adjust texture ‚Äúintensity‚Äù but I‚Äôm not
sure that is ‚Äúbrighter‚Äù.  Possibly lighting increase needed, and
possibly a different texture.</p>
<p>Animation:<br>
All the animation happens in lines 155-182.  In the original, I used one
 ‚ÄòaddInPlace‚Äô for position anim, and another for rotation anim.  This
one‚Ä¶ has the position anim disabled, and TWO rotation addInPlaces‚Ä¶ one
doing Y (lines 168-172), another doing X (lines 174-178).</p>
<p>This is simple animation, but understand that EACH addInPlace could
have its OWN timeline, its own step, and its own softener(s).  And
remember that you could do softener*2 or step/2 (or similar stuff) in
any addInPlace section.</p>
<p>Lines 163, 170, 177‚Ä¶ they are each vector3‚Äôs to be added-In-Place
each frame, and they are essentially the ‚Äúchange since last frame‚Äù
(sometimes called the ‚Äòdelta‚Äô).</p>
<p>And, you know sin and cos are cyclers‚Ä¶ essentially back-n-forth
oscillators.  You can think of sin as ONE bike pedal, and cos as the
other.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Step is VERY important.  Often, when you adjust step, you need to
adjust other things, too.  Step adjusts both speed and amount of effect.
  So, sometimes we adjust the speed of the animation, but then the
amount of movement becomes too little or big, so the softeners need
re-adjusting.</p>
<p>Softeners (attenuators) can be used as amplifiers, too‚Ä¶ depending
upon if you use them as a divisor or a multiplicand.  (What the hell did
 he say?)  (ie. You can sometimes divide-by softener, and sometimes
multiply-by softener).  I probably should have named it ‚Äòscaler‚Äô or
‚Äòrange‚Äô or something like that.</p>
<p>And, camera angle is also important, esp .beta (the 1.8 seen in line 12).</p>
<p>This reflection version is still looking directly at the ‚Äúpole‚Äù of
the texture.  You can see the texture‚Äôs pole‚Ä¶ pass vertically thru the
letter surfaces‚Ä¶ twice per anim cycle‚Ä¶ once going up, once going down.</p>
<p>If you would like to NOT see the texture pole pass thru the fonts, adjust that camera beta‚Ä¶ OR‚Ä¶ you can do what I did in the <a href="http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/37487-text-as-polygon-mesh/?do=findComment&amp;comment=231443" rel="nofollow noopener">old forum post</a>‚Ä¶ where we changed line 91 ‚Äòxyz‚Äô into ‚Äòzyx‚Äô.  That might work.</p>
<p>Do you see how you could eliminate the 2nd rotation anim‚Ä¶ by replacing the first zero in line 170‚Ä¶ with the <code>(Math.sin(timeline)/softener)</code>
 from line 177?  (add/remove parentheses as wanted).  Then, line 170
would be animating both X and Y, and then lines 173-178 could be
removed.</p>
<p>I turned OFF position animator‚Ä¶ because‚Ä¶ it gets to be too much, and
also‚Ä¶ it needs to be programmed more carefully than I have done, so far.
  Up in that section (lines 164/165)‚Ä¶ you can see that I used the ‚Äòi‚Äô
indexer variable in some of the calcs.  That‚Ä¶ is weird‚Ä¶ and can have
strange effects.  Generally speaking, when using the i-indexer in calcs,
 left-most letters get little effect, right-most letters get LOTS of
effect.  This is not an overly-useful movement and can make words
difficult to read.</p>
<p>Ok, I hope this helps.  You should have some tools to cause trouble-with, now.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
  Don‚Äôt accidentally blow-up the planet.  Perhaps someday, we will add
pre-made MeshWriter ‚Äúanimation behaviors‚Äù that can be applied to a
single letter, a single word, a single sentence, or an entire message.  I
 am also hoping to apply path-following, soon, and have begun studies on
 paths.  I‚Äôve tested only camera-flying and single object-flying, so
far.  Thx to <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/johnk">@JohnK</a> and others‚Ä¶ for helping me learn about paths.</p>

        <p>Hey TL‚Ä¶ in this ‚Äúreflection-texture‚Äù application (chrome
fonts)‚Ä¶ do you see why (blocky?) fonts with LOTS of surface area, work
best?  Yeah, sometimes ‚Äúfat fonts‚Äù are difficult to read, because their
‚Äúholes and slots‚Äù are small‚Ä¶ but, if we could somehow activate one more
set of fonts‚Ä¶ big fat mamas‚Ä¶ that would be great.  The more surface area
 of the font faces, the better chance that the viewer can ‚Äúmake out‚Äù
what the reflection texture is showing.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs say the texture is a pano of the greater metro El Segundo
skyline.  The more surface area on the fonts, the more chance that
viewers will recognize it as El Segundo‚Ä¶ because more of the picture
will be seen in the font faces.</p>
<p>HOW IMPORTANT is it‚Ä¶ that viewers recognize the reflected picture?  I dunno.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
  Depends upon the programmer/artist‚Ä¶ and what is trying to be
communicated, I guess.  Brick patterns‚Ä¶ easily recognized.  ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs
Waldo/Wally‚Äù pictures‚Ä¶ perhaps more important.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It takes a long time to tweak a fontFamily into being MeshWriter-tolerable, doesn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>For those who don‚Äôt know, <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/theleftover">@TheLeftover</a> is the original coder of the MeshWriter fonts/system‚Ä¶ used in that demo.  Attaboy to <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/jerome">@jerome</a>,
 too, for creating the Solid Particle System (SPS) used in MeshWriter
ops.  I think MeshWriter/similar‚Ä¶ has a HUGE future‚Ä¶ for reading
ANYTHING while-within a virtual reality scene.</p>
<p>GUI textBlock controls have usage in VR, too‚Ä¶ but there‚Äôs nothing
prettier than 3D fonts, and they can do physics/collisions, can have
on-font textures, be used as particle emitters, and they can pirouette.
 GUI textBlock controls will shatter, if they try a pirouette.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And for teaching kids to read, there‚Äôs NOTHING like dancing fonts/words‚Ä¶ keeps them wanting more and more sentences to pass-by.</p>
<p>Perhaps a pretty forest scene with text-paths winding out of the
brush‚Ä¶ passing-alongside the campfire.  Kids would sit and read for
HOURS and HOURS and HOURS.  Pictures dance-by, among the words.  3D
characters‚Ä¶ too‚Ä¶  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a cone‚Äù‚Ä¶  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a parallelogram‚Äù‚Ä¶ so much goooood
stuff‚Ä¶ to babysit those annoying kids-with.  heh.</p>
<p>Parades.  Sentence parades, newsfeed parades, mesh parades, sprite
parades, anything that can follow a path‚Ä¶ can be paraded.  Everyone
loves parades.  Does anyone know what a Kerbal‚Ä¶ is?  How about Trolls?
We need some cutesy 3D characters‚Ä¶ tractors, lawnmowers, train
locomotives, things that can path-pull a parade of MeshWriter words and
assorted happy-stuff.  Maybe some particle emitters to spray confetti,
and maybe a little John Phillips Sousa marching music
(calliope/bandwagon), etc.   SO coooooool.</p>
<p>Parade Manager 1.0.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  ‚ÄúPath-Wrangling and Media-Herding‚Ä¶ done right.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Well, the letters will always be flat on top, right?  I make
shapes in two dimensions and then it gets extruded, or whatever.  That
is the basic algorithm.</p>
<p>For my uses, I never notice.  It is absolutely the most noticed when
one does super-fat letters with a reflective texture.  (hmmm . . . )  I
remember looking at curving the 3rd dimension . . . and getting mental
vapor lock.  I am pretty sure it is beyond me unless I can get
Archimedes in here to write that part of the code.</p>
<p>The two dimensions that <em>are</em> curved, are approximated, of
course.  The number of faces in a curve (say the outside of a ‚Äò0‚Äô) is a
function of a value embedded in the code and the way the font was
originally written.  The default value was intended to be pretty
economical but look OK.  I could incorporate a dialer to tune that to a
couple different settings.</p>
<p>Yes.  Putting a new font in MeshWriter is laborious.  So is writing
tools to speed font conversion.  If we were producing more fonts, I
would gradually tune up the tools ‚Äì I thought.</p>
<p>I have zero information on usage.  I am unaware of anyone taking anything <em>to</em> <em>users</em>
 using MeshWriter, besides me.  (I will say this, there are frequent
visits to the playgrounds you created that sport MeshWriter.  I know
this because they all source from my server.)  I would expect that, if
there was much usage (other than my friend Wingnut) I would hear about
some deficiencies.</p>

<p>Little slots, little holes, lots of facial surface area.  Super easy
to see the image inside the fonts, but not very easy to read the words,
unfortunately.  Trade-off.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs probably 3-6 different font widths‚Ä¶ involved in that font
family.  Compare the ‚ÄúI‚Äù to the ‚ÄúN‚Äù.  3 times wider?  Maybe more?  Might
 be a challenge to do auto-kerning, but boundingBox.extends.x might be
able to measure each SPS-based character-mesh, and do the auto-kern.
(for those in question, kern = letter-spacing, or X-spacing)</p>
<p>Those fonts are perhaps a little TOO ‚Äúplump‚Äù, but you get the idea.
Notice how the fonts are somewhat narrow, too, allowing them to be
tightly kerned.  These are all caps, so no descenders‚Ä¶ allowing tight
vertical stacking of words, too (line-spacing).  Love it.</p>
<p>Later, we‚Äôll actually run a movie inside the fonts.

Ok, continuing from message <span class="hashtag">#49</span>‚Ä¶ I used <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/johnk">@JohnK</a>‚Äôs  <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1PX9G0" rel="nofollow noopener">#4 example from the path demo</a> (line 69 formula)‚Ä¶ in my other path demo‚Ä¶ which we COULD call ‚ÄúThe OT‚Äù (orthoganous tobogganous).  Let‚Äôs have a look:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#55" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#55</a>
  (line 131 uses line 69 orthoganator formula)  (disable line 105 to
detach cam from car) (increase points in line 87‚Ä¶ to slow the travel
speed)</p>
<p>Just like <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1HH4OJ#17" rel="nofollow noopener">Jerome‚Äôs rollercoaster</a>, our ‚Äúcar‚Äù is staying reasonably heads-up (not much roll), while doing proper pitching and yawing to follow the path.</p>
<p>And just like Jerome‚Äôs rollercoaster, we have a ‚Äúglitch‚Äù at one point
 in the track, probably where path-end meets path-start.  hmm.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/how_to_use_curve3#example-2" class="inline-onebox" rel="nofollow noopener">Draw Curves - Babylon.js Documentation</a> (scroll down tiny bit)</p>
<p>While touring-around in Path3D docs and assorted related docs, I find this ‚Äú<a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#2GCEVH" rel="nofollow noopener">Playground Example - Closed Joined Curves</a>‚Äù.</p>
<p>That path has one SEVERE-angle place, and one pretty good bump‚Ä¶ both
along the upper right side‚Ä¶ so I dunno if THAT method of closed-loop
path-growing‚Ä¶ is any different/better than what has been tried, so far.</p>
<p>I was just looking for a better ‚Äútie‚Äù point.  (seam where start meets
 end).  If we‚Äôre going to run a monorail system‚Ä¶ we need good seams and
smooth rail.  MeshWriter fonts would get motion-sick when they hit that
bump in the rail.  And you KNOW those MeshWriter fonts - they BITCH
about EVERYTHING.  heh.  If they don‚Äôt get a smooth ride along a path‚Ä¶
we‚Äôre going to ‚Äúhear about it.‚Äù <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I wonder what that ‚Äúglitch‚Äù is.  Quaternion spaz-out?  Perhaps a bump
 where the rail was soldered/welded?  Are we missing a path-point, and
thus have a ‚Äúgap‚Äù to jump?</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs do some more experiments.  Here is a <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#56" rel="nofollow noopener">showNormals helper</a>, or maybe better for us, a <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#57" rel="nofollow noopener">showBinormals helper</a>.</p>
<p>Yep, I see an issue.  Abnormal normals at the border.  hmm.  A wall will likely NOT improve anything.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/open_mouth.png" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"> Being a PathMaster is more complex than I first imagined.</p>

        <p>As usual I like to simplify things so I can see what is going
 on, so goodbye skybox, extra meshes and the camera following the
carBody and back to a plane for the carBody rather than a box. Also have
 cloned the carBody at its start position.<br>

You can see that when the carBody approaches the end to restart its has
rotated itself around the path. Checking out the console you can see
that the final and first tangents are the same but not the normals and
binormals. This will be down to the chooses made on how the normals and
binormals are calculated going around the path and given for any point
on the path there are an infinite number of vectors that can be chosen
as a normal to the path the selection of a good method for a closed path
 is difficult. Will have another look to morrow.</p>

        <p>Hiya aF!  Yeah, that sort-of sounds correct‚Ä¶ maybe.  (I sound sure-of-myself, eh?)</p>
<p>A guy could ponder‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhat IS the relationship of a pitch‚Äôn‚Äôyaw (x/y) rotation‚Ä¶ to a direction/axis?‚Äù</p>
<p>Why did the car roll (z-rot) AT ALL?  Probably something involving ‚Äúgoes-around, comes-around‚Äù  <img src="twc8_e2_files/smiley.png" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">
  But, with a goes-around, comes-around issue (spirography), I would

different.  hmm.</p>
<p>Axis IS a direction, though‚Ä¶ I think.  Or not.  Directions need a
magnitude, but so does an axis, I think.  All-in-all, Mister Direction

<p>It is the normal and binormal that gives the rotation of the car body about the path.</p>
<p>Here is an interesting version <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#63" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#63</a>
 This has a fixed normal all the way round. Sometimes the card appears
to flick around, ie the rotation looks wrong. Focus on where this
happens on the path and move the camera around to view that part of the
path from different angles and at the appropriate angles you will see a
smooth movement of the card. So in these cases it is to do with the
viewing angle not the movement. (I am suggesting that even in the real
world from some angles it would appear that the car would flick around).
 However there is one section of the curve I cannot find a smooth
transition view - at a very kinky part of the path.</p>

        <p>Nod.  Thx John.  An incorrect rotation that is eased-into‚Ä¶ is fine, and perhaps understandable.</p>
<p>But ‚Äúfast-jerk rotation-change‚Äù is not <em>normal</em>, and is not going to work for trains or parading of mesh or cameras.  The <span class="hashtag">#62</span> playground is perfect‚Ä¶ except for where end meets start.  It has only one fast-jerk rotation, where <span class="hashtag">#63</span> has two.</p>
<p>I have a goofy idea.  Let‚Äôs say we put a lookAT target in the middle
of the circle-path.  This lookAt target constantly moves up/down‚Ä¶ to
exactly match the worldSpace Y-height of the car, and the car constantly
 does car.lookAt(lookatTarget) with its RIGHT face (or left face if path
 travel is reversed).  No rotation is ever set with code calculations.
All rotation is done by right-side lookAt‚Äôs.</p>
<p>We could use the optional rotationOffset feature of lookAt‚Ä¶ to make the car‚Äôs right-side‚Ä¶ be the lookAt face.</p>
<p>This system is essentially a telephone pole in the center of the
path-circle‚Ä¶ that a lookAt target moves up/down along.  This would also
allow me to do banking.  In our case, a hard-right banking could happen
if lookAt target is lower than car.position.y.</p>
<p>One problem.  LookAt likely affects car yaw and pitch, TOO.  That‚Ä¶
can‚Äôt be allowed to happen.  It must ONLY affect car roll.  AND‚Ä¶ this is
 only ONE car.  When we have 300 characters of MeshWriter fonts
traveling the path‚Ä¶ all characters will have a different ROLL-rotation
than each other (because they are each at their own unique path-point
and worldSpace altitude).  That would mean that EACH character in the
fonts-train‚Ä¶ would need its OWN PERSONAL lookAt target moving up/down
the center pole.  OUCH!</p>
<p>What if I ‚Äúhung‚Äù a disabled car-parented freeCam‚Ä¶ from the
BOTTOM-face of the car‚Ä¶ and set freecam.applyGravity = true?  heh.
Should get good heads-up on the car, AND get some banking due-to‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶
camera.inertia.  heheh.</p>
<p>NOOOOO, that won‚Äôt work.  But‚Ä¶ yeah, physics-active ‚Äúkeel‚Äù hanging
beneath the car(s)‚Ä¶ would likely work pretty good‚Ä¶ up-to-a point (ar ar)
 (a point of CPU bog due-to too many mesh on-the-path/in-frustum).</p>
<p>hmm.  Just thinkin‚Äô.  I don‚Äôt think the current method of controlling
 rotation‚Ä¶ is going to work.  Thx for your study and work, though.  All
comments/ideas welcome, always.</p>
<p>Perhaps I will try a playground, using the ‚Äúvariable-altitude lookAt
target‚Äù (VALT) idea, unless someone beats me to it.  I have some
real-life junk to do first, but, it‚Äôs NOT snow-blowing!  YAY!</p>

        <p>Hi again, gang!</p>
<p>In the continuing story of our Path3d-playing, here‚Äôs a <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#67" rel="nofollow noopener">new version - #67</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/src/Maths/math.ts#L6953" rel="nofollow noopener">the source code for Path3d</a>,
 there is MUCH talk about ‚Äúfirst normal‚Äù which‚Ä¶ is a user-settable
parameter in the Path3d constructor.  So, I set mine‚Ä¶ to ‚Äúup‚Äù vector‚Ä¶
line 115.</p>
<p>Then‚Ä¶ I put a sphere ‚Äúatop‚Äù the carBody‚Ä¶ to indicate which-way is UP,
 for IT.  You can think of it as the head of a human, riding in our
roller-coaster car.</p>
<p>Tests showed that the green Bi-Normals were aligned with the rider‚Äôs
head.  We ACTUALLY want the white Normals aligned with rider‚Äôs head‚Ä¶
because‚Ä¶ we set our ‚Äúfirst normal‚Äù to v3.Up() in the Path3d constructor.</p>
<p>So‚Ä¶ being the brave-but-blind explorer that I am‚Ä¶ i re-arranged the
ORDER of the arrays in our line 161 rotation formula.  It WAS:<br>
<code>RotationFromAxis(normals[i], binormals[i], tangents[i]);</code></p>
<p>I eventually (trial‚Äôn‚Äôerror-) found THIS order:<br>
<code>RotationFromAxis(tangents[i], normals[i], binormals[i]);</code></p>
<p>Now we have the white normals, passing thru the rider‚Äôs head‚Ä¶ looking
 good.  BiNormals are cross-product, as they should be (like I know what
 a cross-product is).  I think all further experiments/playgrounds‚Ä¶
should use this new formula-order.</p>
<p>If we look at (<a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/johnk">@JohnK</a>‚Äôs?) playground example of the <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1PX9G0" rel="nofollow noopener">6 path-following planes</a>,
 examining lines 59-77, it is not unusual for tangents[i] to be the
FIRST parameter.  Case 0 and case 1 both have tangents as the first
parameter.  I chose to use case 3 (example 4) because the plane on the
fourth ‚Äúpath follower‚Äù‚Ä¶ stays orthoganous to its tobagganous.</p>
<p>In other words, the plane stays perpendicular to the path-line‚Ä¶ all the time‚Ä¶ exactly what I (and toboggan riders)‚Ä¶ wish-for.</p>
<p>But maybe, case 3 (example 4) should be adjusted to match our NEW formula order.</p>
<p>Now that our formula ‚Äúorder‚Äù has changed, I decided to remove the optional <code>BABYLON.Vector3.Up()</code> ‚Äúfirst normal‚Äù from the line 115 Path3d constructor, to see what the Path3d code uses as a default <em>firstNormal</em> value.  Does Path3d set <em>firstNormal</em> as ‚Äúup‚Äù, by default?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#68" rel="nofollow noopener">PG #68</a> tells us the answer, as does <a href="https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/src/Maths/math.ts#L6974" rel="nofollow noopener">source code line 6974</a>.  It appears to set <em>firstNormal</em> = null, by default.  And we can see a difference in <span class="hashtag">#67</span> and <span class="hashtag">#68</span> playgrounds, though BOTH (-erations?) have the white normals passing thru the rider‚Äôs head‚Ä¶ properly.</p>
<p>If we want to follow firstNormal a bit‚Ä¶ it is used again in <a href="https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/src/Maths/math.ts#L6981" rel="nofollow noopener">source code line 6981</a>, and arrives at the _compute function to be used in <a href="https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/src/Maths/math.ts#L7056" rel="nofollow noopener">src line 7056</a>.</p>
<p>From there, it arrives in the <a href="https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/src/Maths/math.ts#L7126" rel="nofollow noopener">helper func called <em>normalVector</em></a> as 2nd parameter <em>va</em>.  From there, it goes to <a href="https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/src/Maths/math.ts#L7133" rel="nofollow noopener">line 7133</a> where it is tested for null-ness (its default value).</p>
<p>If null, it goes into that brain tumor epsilon stuff.  I believe
epsilon stuff is a type of ‚Äúrounding‚Äù, and a mechanism to avoid a
divide-by-zero error.  In Star Trek lingo, it makes sure that the
transporter places the human on ONE side of the wall, OR the OTHER side,
 but not ‚Äúinto‚Äù the wall.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Anyway, I am simply telling of my experiments and things learned.  No
 miraculous discoveries, but still better than accidentally peeing-on
your own foot, right?  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>You DID IT!  Freakin‚Äô-A!  (Wingy dances around like an idiot)</p>
<p>Hooray!  Holy crap.  3-parameter call, eh?<br>
<code>this._normalVector(tg0, this._curve[0], firstNormal);</code></p>
<p>Interesting.  This PG disables (overrides?) the optional <em>firstNormal</em> parameter for Path3d constructor, but who cares?  No jerk-rotations.  YAY!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#71" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#71</a></p>
<p>I still like having the normals bisect our rider‚Äôs head, and not the
binormals, so, I changed the formula order again.  Later, if/when the
optional <em>firstNormal</em> parameter is honored again, I might be able to return the formula order‚Ä¶ to original order.</p>
<p>All in all, congrats, JK!  Fantastic!  We‚Äôre on our way, again.  THANK YOU!  Nice work!</p>
<p>I suppose, somehow, we‚Äôre still seeking a no-car-roll version‚Ä¶ where
the rider‚Äôs head stays as vertical as-possible, roll-wise.  Natually,
car <em>pitch</em> is going to affect rider UP-vector, but that‚Äôs fine.
 If we could accomplish growing paths that TRY to maintain rider head-up
 (roll-wise), that would be great.</p>
<p>That way, I get full-control of the banking (car z-rotation/roll),
and NO control of banking is given to the path3d ‚Äúgrower‚Äù formula.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure HOW I will manually program banking, but, physics is a
possibility.  By dangling/hanging/suspending a joint and pendulum-weight
 beneath each ‚Äútrain car‚Äù‚Ä¶ and ONLY allowing carBodyImpostor ROLL‚Ä¶ that
might work.   We cannot ‚Äúlock‚Äù physics pitch and yaw.  Instead, pitch
and yaw must ‚Äúfree-wheel‚Äù - controlled only by path, not by physics.
Only impostor roll‚Ä¶ would be honored by our car.  Weird thing, huh?</p>
<p>MAYBE‚Ä¶a special Path3d grower‚Ä¶ COULD tilt the normals on the corners‚Ä¶
 by itself‚Ä¶ and we would have a .bankingIntensity property.  The amount
of car upVector roll-tilt‚Ä¶ would be based-upon the amount of x and z
change‚Ä¶ between current point and next point.  Sideways (lateral)
inertia calculations.  Fancy.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>The solution above is cool. <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/wingnut">@Wingnut</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/johnk">@JohnK</a> - thanks. Your writing on: normals, binormals, orthogonals, is a fun read. Highest honor: <img src="twc8_e2_files/black_heart.png" title=":black_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":black_heart:"></p>
<p>UPDATE: followed through the experiment very interesting!</p>
<p>Seems like the SOLUTION was to reorder tangents and first normals!?! Interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wingnut, if I wrote something that offended you - I apologize.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not at all, aFalcon, you have never offended me, not even a little.
And you speak just fine, and thanks for the kind words about TWC.  Very
nice of you!</p>
<p>The problem is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not very smart.  Almost everyone around here‚Ä¶
knows more about 3d, math, and JS‚Ä¶ than I do.  And when I do learn
something, I forget it quite often/quickly.</p>
<p>But, I have a darned good time‚Ä¶ hanging-out with you pro developers.
 It‚Äôs a very enjoyable part of my life, and ya‚Äôll are high-valued
acquaintances.   You guys all amaze me, and I‚Äôm honored to be included
in the community.</p>
<p>The direction (angle) thing you brought-up‚Ä¶ in an earlier post‚Ä¶ sort
of blew my mind.  Immediately I got axes and direction vectors all
confused and blurry.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/smiley.png" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Jerome‚Äôs rollercoaster is really not a good place to study severe
direction changes, because he built that rollercoaster out of ‚Äúpieces‚Äù
of various formulas‚Ä¶ paths mixed with beziers mixed with who knows what
else.  His path is much more complicated than the one we are
playing-with, here.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the input about paths and banking that you just gave
us.  Excellent.  We need all the input we can get.  We want to make
Path3d as versatile as possible, and learn when and where to use it.</p>
<p>I really like our rotationFromAxis() function.  It allows us full
control of the car‚Ä¶ IF we learn to bend the normals EXACTLY how we want
them bent.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
  That allows us to have a ‚Äúdumb vehicle‚Äù‚Ä¶ where the car isn‚Äôt needing
to do much calculating as it travels.  When we get many train-cars or
MeshWriter fonts traveling the path‚Ä¶ dumb-cars will have better
performance and unlimited-cars-scale-ability.</p>
<p>And yes, I, too, ran into ‚Äúthe difference‚Äù between a flat path, and a
 rolling-hills path.  At first, I saw no hope, but then I found other
people‚Äôs tests‚Ä¶ and got excited!  I am real impressed and happy with
what we have done here, so far.  I would prefer NOT to use physics‚Ä¶ but
instead‚Ä¶ grow a path3d that has variable banking built-in‚Ä¶ BECAUSE of
the way we built the path3D.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm WAY BEHIND on the learning curve3d, but‚Ä¶ again, I‚Äôm having one
helluva good time, playing with tech that I really love, which has great
 self-satisfaction and self-gratification.  A guy couldn‚Äôt ask for more.
  It‚Äôs the best hobby in the world.</p>

</aside>
<p>you are right, wasn‚Äôt talking about force. Just surprised roll
direction can be different direction for different objects, and thought
it worth sharing. Since my task is opposite(as usual). I see you ran
into something similar before. Yes like a motorcycle is different than
car!(below). I‚Äôll try both: roll-in and roll-out. But I‚Äôll study up on
binormals and RotationFromAxis() first. Thx.</p>

        <p>Well, you were talking about roll-rotation‚Ä¶ based on physics.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can manually-roll any object, any way you wish.  But‚Ä¶ given
 a flat turn to the right, the surfer will try to go straight‚Ä¶ possibly
leaving the surfboard to the left during the turn (inertia/momentum).
He/She will tumble ass-over-tea-kettle‚Ä¶ +z.  (or fly thru the air with
possibly NO significant rotation)</p>
<p>The car does the same, or the driver of the car.  The car will roll
+z, or the driver will be ejected out-of the driver‚Äôs side window (left -
 for USA cars).</p>
<p>In a clockwise centrifuge, any object will try to tumble +z and try to exit to the outside.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  No chance of tumbling -z and moving toward the center.</p>
<p>Motorcycles (and surfers) lean in the direction of the turn‚Ä¶ to prevent tumble toward ‚Äúthe outside‚Äù. <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Am I wrong?  Physics-wise, the vehicle-type does not matter for
natural roll direction (if the pivot-point == center of gravity/mass).
At least I THINK that is true.  I could be wrong.  Party on.</p>

<p>binormals and RotationFromAxis()</p>

</aside>
<p>Hi again.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Really, we just need to study the _compute function.  I don‚Äôt know how closely you have been following-along.  In PG‚Äôs <span class="hashtag">#69</span>/<span class="hashtag">#71</span>, <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/johnk">@JohnK</a>
 created a modified _compute() in lines 2-39‚Ä¶ that fixes the mis-aligned
 normals that happened at the path start-end intersection.  That func
still has one problem‚Ä¶ it ignores the optional ‚ÄúfirstNormal‚Äù parameter
in a Path3D constructor.  I‚Äôm hoping our little team can find that issue
 and recover it.</p>
<p>The <span class="hashtag">#71</span> playground car - its roll
rotation is essentially dictated/ordered‚Ä¶ by the white normals (no
joystick or keyboard allowed‚Ä¶ all robot-controlled).</p>
<p>Sooooo‚Ä¶ hmm‚Ä¶ for THIS application (robot-grown path3d‚Äôs), we might be
 able to adjust the compute() function‚Ä¶ to add some tilt to its normals‚Ä¶
 based upon the X/Z relationship of CURRENT pathpoint (cpp)‚Ä¶ to NEXT
pathpoint (npp).   In effect, we want to measure the X and Z difference
between cpp and npp, and use that factor in normals computations.
Previous path-point (ppp) might get involved, too.</p>
<p>There is NO axis at the path-point when _compute() runs.  IT‚Ä¶
derives/calcs the axis of cpp.  At that point (ar ar)‚Ä¶ it has the
ability to attempt realistic, but still robot-created and ‚Äúfixed-value‚Äù‚Ä¶
 banking (simulated).</p>
<p>For a 500-pt path like pg <span class="hashtag">#71</span>, lines 27-38 of _compute() runs 500 times before the scene‚Äôs first render‚Ä¶ creating an axis for each point.</p>
<p>If your interests are with player-controlled banking, then
robot-faked banking is not going to be very interesting for you.
Really, hacking on _compute() is the main target for this project, right
 now.</p>
<p>Want a synopsis?  I knew ya did.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Line 5:  Probably a lie.  I think the code following it ONLY deals
with FIRST tangent, and not last.  But, first/last values COULD be
identical.  Unlikely, though, unless the first/last points are
over-layed, position-wise.  (2 points in one place)</p>
<p>Lines 10-20:  This section is all ‚Äúinit‚Äù code‚Ä¶ trying to prepare the
FIRST point/normal/axis.  This is likely the area where optional
firstNormal parameter is being over-ridden or somehow ignored.</p>
<p>Lines 21-33:  Uber-hot!  Lines 29/32/33‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs where we would add
simu-banking‚Ä¶ to influence the normals into tilting‚Ä¶ in a banking-like
way (with adjustable intensity and likely a reverseBanking boolean
option, too).</p>
<p>In <span class="hashtag">#71</span> PG, change line 97 <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/api/classes/babylon.path3d#constructor" rel="nofollow noopener">Path3d constructor</a> to:<br>
<code>var path3d = new BABYLON.Path3D(points, BABYLON.Vector3.Down());</code></p>
<p>No change in scene seen.  BABYLON.Vector3.Down() (and 5 similar
statics ie. Left()) is being ignored/over-ridden.  Likely an issue in
line 12, a line modified by <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/johnk">@JohnK</a>.
  John also modified lines 33/34, I think.  HOPEFULLY, those lines are
ok, and we can modify line 12 area‚Ä¶ without re-introducing the start-end
 problem.</p>
<p>These grown paths we do here‚Ä¶ are fire-and-forget.  They are grown in
 a certain way, and dynamic on-the-fly (ar ar) adjusting of the
path/normals‚Ä¶ is likely implausible, as it will require growing a new
500-pt path.</p>
<p>As for BInormals, they are created in lines 34-37.  They are simply
derived from the Cross of the normal, but they are highly important
because they provide one ‚Äúradial‚Äù (yaw) of the 3 needed for our
rotationFromAxis() ‚Äúmotor‚Äù.</p>
<p><em>curTang</em> is probably the direction of the path, similar-to or identical-to‚Ä¶ car.rotation Forward() / Back().  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent" rel="nofollow noopener">Wiki - tangent</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, now you know MY ‚Äútrain‚Äù of thought on this project.  I‚Äôm an exciting storyteller, eh?  <img src="twc8_e2_files/smiley.png" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> (snore)</p>
<p>White normals, brown abnormals, emBANKments‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a distasteful border-wall joke around here SOMEWHERE. heh</p>

<p>binormal is a cross of the normal, got it. Looking at Epsilon‚Ä¶ 0.001. Source code gr8!</p>
<p><em>After following the experiment through - the modification of the compute function is remarkable.</em></p>
<p>Many things learned above. See you mentioned a boolean switch on banking direction.</p>
<p>Excited to attempt non-math implementation of curve this week - and understanding normals better is big help.</p>
<p>You are correct - the robot curves are not applicable to
implementation, it is a custom curve. Apparently, all the normals will
be UP. So a curve in xz plane.</p>
<p><em>Any way to EDIT normals on a curve? (set them all to UP?)</em><br>
We have the curve and yep - normals all over!<br>
I suppose it is in the normal array?<br>
Sounds fun. Cant wait.<br>
I‚Äôll shareback whatever ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>It was also used later for enemy movements (with JK‚Äôs help) around an infinity path.</p>

<p>Hiya bird! <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For MY use, they must be ‚Äúup‚Äù‚Ä¶ ROLL-WISE-ONLY.  A ‚Äúpure up‚Äù will kill the pitch of the car for non-flat paths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could be done.  Starting to lean-towards Jerome‚Äôs rollercoaster.
Interpolation is actually frame-points between the path-points, which is
 adding more points‚Ä¶ so you are possibly self-defeating, and you will
also have a difficult time maintaining consistent path-speed, if that is
 sought.  I need to study animations around bezier curves‚Ä¶ to speak
intelligently about that.  Are keyframe-points more compressed (closer
together) around tight turns, as compared to straighter-stretches?  hmm.
  Do animation speeds around corners‚Ä¶ slow-down because of that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not really an offset on ‚Äúcurve‚Äù, at least not the <em>curve</em>
array.  Curve array is positions, and we don‚Äôt want those to change
(unless we plot a new path3d).  We only want to roll the rotation of the
 car.  There MAY BE certain applications where the car would
positionally ‚Äúside-slide‚Äù away-from the path track, or maybe jump above
the path-track, but I have no need for that, yet.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
  My goal is trains and roller-coasters, so far.  Many cars,
consistently spaced, no matter the speed of the first car.  Think
sentences‚Ä¶ where the distance between letters is adjustable, and so is
the gap between words.  Once the sentence-train is traveling the path,
the letter and word spacing must remain consistent/locked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, that is similar to the ‚Äúsmart-path‚Äù idea of long-ago‚Ä¶ where
each point contains information about what the car should do AT THAT
POINT.  (in a way, that‚Äôs what we are already doing.)  Your idea would
still require ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù all the metaData in every point, and/or robot
doing the animation interpolations.   But yep, certainly a possibility.
 I still have much work to do on this more-standard method‚Ä¶ before I
wander-off into ‚Äúintelligent paths/points‚Äù.  Research at-will, of
course.  (thx!)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your <span class="hashtag">#1</span> would help my cause‚Ä¶ the most.
Normals that are all UP roll-wise, is definitely something that I need
to do with _compute() before any tilted-normals banking experiments can
start.  But the UP normals cannot be UP‚Ä¶ PITCH-wise, or else the car
will not aim up/down hills.  Thanks for any help/contributions on that.</p>
<p>I would REALLY like to get the Path3d 2nd parameter <em>firstNormal</em> working correctly FIRST, as that will affect SO MANY other things.  Party on!</p>

        <p>Haha‚Ä¶ yep, ub bizarro, for sure.  Fun thinkings, though‚Ä¶ I was ‚Äúwith you‚Äù for the whole read.  Fun!</p>
<p>Keep in mind‚Ä¶ that lookAt sucks for trains.  100-car train, all
following a SINGLE roll-only lookAt target‚Ä¶ causes all train cars to do
that same lookAt/banking.  Not right.  In true train-land‚Ä¶ the front of
the train may be well into the banked corner, while the back of the
train‚Ä¶ still on the flat-lands‚Ä¶ not yet arrived at the turn.</p>
<p>Yes, it would take 100 separate lookAt targets moving up/down an
invisible pole in the middle of the circular path‚Ä¶ each with their own
private altitude.  Gruesome.  I must stay on current target‚Ä¶ growing
fake-banking into the compute().  All other dreaming allowed and
encouraged, of course.</p>
<p>In parts of your post‚Ä¶ you like to say ‚Äúslower‚Äù and ‚Äúfaster‚Äù‚Ä¶ but you
 don‚Äôt specify which phase‚Ä¶ growing the path, or driving many mesh
along-it.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  We probably don‚Äôt care how long it takes to grow a path.</p>
<p>Motoring a MeshWriter-fonts (3d fonts) train-of-text‚Ä¶ displaying the <a href="https://lite.cnn.io/en" rel="nofollow noopener">latest CNN headlines</a>‚Ä¶ speed/perf might be important, there.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Drive-perf, not grow-perf.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Bones.  hehe.  Using bones to actually DRAG the cars behind the
locomotive, and using bone-length for spaces between words and
characters on the text-train.  Good idea‚Ä¶ maybe.  The train is one long
‚Äúspine‚Äù.  heh.  I kind-of like that idea.</p>
<p>Bone-binding to the lookAt target?  Ok for single vehicle.  Fun!</p>
<p>Ever ponder‚Ä¶ that we could fly an object around in-space‚Ä¶ smoothly‚Ä¶

<p>Hey, if the railroads can move from path to path, so can we (I fig).  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: separates SPEED of car from number of POINTS on path. So path points can be anything, and speed can vary.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE: not a noticeable difference</p>
<p>PROBLEM: Governed by TIME is a SPEED problem for different DISTANCES,
 solved by adding magnitude to SmartPath. Also easing. Still y = 0;</p>

        <p>Regarding freezing pg bjs version, would it not be relatively
 easy to add, just by relying on something like jsdelivr, where you can
explicitly set a version from github tags or commit.</p>
<p>I for example use:<br>
DebugLayer.InspectorURL = <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BabylonJS/Babylon.js@4.0.0-alpha.22/dist/preview%20release/inspector/babylon.inspector.bundle.max.js" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BabylonJS/Babylon.js@4.0.0-alpha.22/dist/preview%20release/inspector/babylon.inspector.bundle.max.js</a><br>
so that the inspector doesn‚Äôt break when using a slightly older version
of babylonjs (which seems to happen relatively frequently).</p>
<p>You can in fact load an old version yourself in the pg (albeit somewhat clumsily):<br>

<p><a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#75" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#75</a></p>
<p>Nothing new in <span class="hashtag">#75</span> except‚Ä¶ I brought-in
_compute()'s partner‚Ä¶ _normalVector().  So now we have (almost) ALL the
portions of the ‚Äúnormals growing system‚Äù‚Ä¶ in the playground‚Ä¶ ready for
easy demented experimenting.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>For those who are lost/new, the _compute and _normalVector funcs at the top of this playground‚Ä¶ have been ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù from the <a href="https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/src/Maths/math.ts#L6953" rel="nofollow noopener">BJS core Path3d system</a>.
  By pasting them at the top of a playground as we have done, we tell
the scene to use OUR functions (for forming our Path3d), and NOT the
default/core functions.  Easy experimenting‚Ä¶ without accidentally
breaking anything important in BJS core-code.  Onward we go‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Also note that my Path3d has a v3.Down() as its optional <em>firstNormal</em>
 parameter‚Ä¶ in line 139.  Adjust or remove, as wanted, of course.
Change to Forward() or Backward() to see that it IS being honored‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶
 not well-honored/used, yet.  Most important for me/us, are likely Up(),
 Down(), Left(), Right().</p>
<p>Other than that, no mods.  I‚Äôm using <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/johnk">@JohnK</a>‚Äôs modified _compute(), and an un-modified _normalVector().  One of John‚Äôs mods‚Ä¶ involves line 34 of _compute().  The <a href="https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/src/Maths/math.ts#L7056" rel="nofollow noopener">ORIGINAL line 34‚Ä¶ only sent TWO params to _normalVector()</a>.  I think John added the optional 3rd parameter.</p>
<p>I see a few ‚Äútwitches‚Äù out there, during the animation.  There are a
few bad welds and bent radials.  Not sure why, yet.  I‚Äôm getting ready
to start some power-hacking.  Lines 186-188 MIGHT be causing one of the
twitch-spots.</p>
<p>Bringing _normalVector() function into the playground‚Ä¶ MIGHT have
changed the Path3d.  Perhaps do some experiments with disabling it, or
comparing PG#75 path to PG#71 path.  Not sure WHY hijacking-in
_normalVector() would matter, unless I borrowed it from the wrong BJS
version or something.</p>
<p>Current objective:  Fix bad welds and bent radials.  Seek all normals
 being DOWN, roll-wise-only (z).  (Because I set v3.Down() as
firstNormal).  Car should not roll/bank left or right (yet)‚Ä¶ but
CAN/MUST ‚Äúpitch‚Äù (x) up/down hills (like it does currently).  Party on!</p>

  I should probably reduce the points a bit‚Ä¶ maybe see something new.

        <p>More roller-coaster fun. Well not so much a roller-coaster at
 the moment just a track with roll.  I wanted to examine just the roll
effect of going round a curve, so as yet no height changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#LEWFVI#1" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#LEWFVI#1</a></p>
<p>Explanation.<br>
As usual I like to start simply. We are building a railway consisting of
 a single line of rails. Each rail has a fixed length and all rails are
the same height above the ground. A car moves along the rail balanced
along a central fixing. For a straight railway people in the car remain
vertical. For a curve made of the rails the people in the car lean
towards the center of the curve.</p>
<p>Building a closed loop with the rails will produce a regular polygon.
 The more rails the larger the radius of the circle around it and the
smaller the angles between the rails.<br>
<img src="twc8_e2_files/861b526cb465f0c0bc03faa8090f6fab2d735287.png" alt="image" width="263" height="272"></p>
<p>The larger the radius the less the curvature of the circle and the
less the people will lean. Curvature is in fact 1/radius. At any
position along the railway we will need to know its curvature to
determine the amount of lean needed at that point.</p>
<p>My first attempts still produce wild variations in normals and binormals<br>

<p>So current attempts smooth these out.</p>
<p>TL; DR</p>
<p>The baseCompute function takes the generated points, an angle,  and a damping factor.<br>
The tangents and curvature at all points are calculated. The cross
products of successive tangents are used to determine if the curve is
inwards or outwards. When there is little difference in the x or z
components of successive tangents they are in a straight line so
curvature is zero. The amount of lean, theta, is calculated from the
curvature found * angle * damping.<br>
The larger the angle used the more the lean, the larger the damping the less the lean.</p>
<p>Angles and tangents are stored.</p>
<p>The angles are then smoothed using a moving average in the function
smooth. This takes two parameters the array to be smoothed and the width
 of the smoothing w, which is how far either side of the current value
to take averages from. With w = 2, the value at index 6, for example,
with become the average of the values at indices, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
That is the larger the w the smoother the angles. Of course too large
wipes out essential differences.</p>
<p>Once the angles have been smoothed the rollCompute calculates the
normals which give the amount the car will lean away from the vertical
and then the binormal using the cross product of thee tangent and
normal.</p>
<p>Also I found the more points used the wilder the normals at the turns
 of the curve. So used less points and set the speed using a weight, the
 greater the weight the slower the car.</p>
<p>You can see that a large number of points with a very large width for the smooth function does not give a smooth ride <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#LEWFVI#2" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#LEWFVI#2</a>.  I am guessing it is something to do with the handling of very small numbers.</p>
<p>Plenty of parameters to play with.</p>

<p>Fun stuff, John.  I was thinking about ‚Äúspherical coordinates‚Äù and
starting with a circle/ring, as you have been thinking.  But when a guy
starts warping that ring, the distance-between-points has to adjust
SOMEHOW‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs where stuff gets ugly.  I can‚Äôt quite wrap my brain
around‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ anything.</p>
<p>One part of me says keep the points equi-distance, and another says
‚Äútighten them up‚Äù on the corners.  When points are spaced
inconsistently, what do we do with travel speed?  sigh.</p>
<p>I think we NEED to allow user-controlled throttle‚Ä¶ somehow‚Ä¶
somewhere‚Ä¶ someday.  But‚Ä¶ should speed affect banking-amount?  Optional?
  With pre-calculated banking‚Ä¶ that would be difficult to do.  But with
on-the-fly banking calculations done by the car itself and its current
speed (real-time)‚Ä¶ maybe can-do.</p>
<p>Has anyone tested if a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6gEphTp2G4" rel="nofollow noopener">gyroscope</a> works in a physics engine?  Anyone know?  (sorry, mental wander)</p>
<p>Spherical coordinates.  <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#J6ZLH#4" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#J6ZLH#4</a>  There‚Äôs some borrowed code in there‚Ä¶ that plots points on the sphere‚Ä¶  at <em>some</em> distance from center.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric_objects" rel="nofollow noopener">Concentricity</a>?

        <p>On the never-ending (circular) path3d subject, here‚Äôs another.</p>

<p>This one is quite different.  Only 50 points define this retarded path (which is grown in lines 186-196).</p>
<p><em>RotationFromAxis</em> is disabled, along with ALL the registerBeforeRender area (all old-style car-moving things - disabled)</p>
<p>ALL movement for THIS non-coasting coaster‚Ä¶ is done within the
onReadyObserver code in lines 282-310.  PURE BJS animation.  YAY!
Positions-animation ONLY, so far.  Yaw/Pitch rotation animation might
only be tangents away from us.</p>
<p>For this positions animation, I just force the <em>points</em> array into being the <em>keyFrames</em> array.  Easy.  A little note:  points array == path3d._path == path3d._curve.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs pretty smooth for being a mere 50 points.  The BJS
Animation-system interpolator is likely inserting steps between each of
our 50 points.  I wonder if we can query the Animation‚Äôs interpolation‚Ä¶
to see how many ‚Äústeps‚Äù it has.  I bet it is more than 50.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I like it.  CarBody changed to cone‚Ä¶ so it is easier to see if/when the carBody has correct yaw/pitch. (it currently doesn‚Äôt)</p>
<p>BJS animation system is doing a good job at positioning our car along the path3d points-path, and we are driver-heads-up (yay!).</p>
<p>Now, we just need pitch and yaw animation.  Roll comes later.</p>
<p>NOTE:  This PG is using an in-playground DEFAULT _<em>compute()</em> because John‚Äôs custom _<em>compute</em>
 removed path3d.distances.  The distances array is mostly unused, but I
wanted to see what it looked-like‚Ä¶ at console.  It is essentially‚Ä¶
mile-posts/km-posts‚Ä¶ might be useful someday.</p>
<p>Update:  <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1YD970#84" rel="nofollow noopener">PG #84</a>
 has both ‚Äúposdrive‚Äù and ‚Äúrotdrive‚Äù animations active.  Rotdrive and
rotkeyFrames are being derived from tangents‚Ä¶ and is not looking
healthy.  But hey, its only our first step, and we have not yet learned
how to avoid ROLL that is on the tangents.  We might need yet another
animation‚Ä¶ floats instead-of vector 3.  One for yaw, one for pitch, and
none for roll.  Three animations total‚Ä¶ yaw(float), pitch(float), and
position(v3).</p>
<p>Disable line 320 to see that I have set/baked initial cone rotation‚Ä¶
so that it aims left-ward with Y-axis up-ward (done in lines 174-176).
All that MIGHT need to be removed.</p>

<p>First 3-animation version.  Float animations on yaw and pitch,
vector3 animation for position.  Default _compute still having problems
with aligning normals at start/end.  Lines 299 &amp; 305 areas‚Ä¶ super
critical (what values to use for yaw and pitch anims).  Still using
Down() as firstNormal.  Lots of work in lines 177-179‚Ä¶ trying to init
NEW-STYLE-car‚Äôs rotation.  Entire scene needs lots of work/thinking,
yet.</p>
<p>Time to bring-in the MeshWriter fonts?  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Yikes.  Really, I need line 285 to work‚Ä¶ animate the ‚ÄúB‚Äù.  But, it
looks like SPS particles are not really ready to be animated.  Soooo, I
animate the entire meshWriter ‚Äúmaster mesh‚Äù in line 288, after some

        <p>Hi gang.<br>
Odd topic, this time.  I just learned that there are people nearby‚Ä¶ who
are being paid to be forum helpers.  SOME seen enthusiasm in others‚Ä¶
that I thought was ‚Äúcommune spirit‚Äù (community)‚Ä¶ is actually paycheck
spirit/duty.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know how to feel about this.  All my forum helping has been powered by‚Ä¶ something different.</p>
<p>When I was working-on the tough and dead-ended Oimo setMotor issue‚Ä¶ I
 kept ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù a sense of rushing‚Ä¶ something was being hurried‚Ä¶ some
‚Äúdead‚Äù line was being sought.  Now I understand why.  Paychecks were
on-the-line.</p>
<p>CHOOSE-TO-be-here‚Äôs‚Ä¶ and HAVE-TO-be-here‚Äôs.  Know the difference. heh.  Erf.</p>
<p>I always knew that there were capitalists among our commune-ity, but I
 never thought they would become the steering committee‚Ä¶ gathering
paychecks based-upon BabylonJS  advancement achievements (produce
results OR ELSE paycheck threats).</p>
<p>Should I be scared?  Should I suddenly have much less enthusiasm towards being a forum helper?</p>
<p>It‚Äôs an odd situation.  I‚Äôm glad I got the list of names‚Ä¶ of the sponsored helpers.</p>
<p>Got opinion?  Got advice for a ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know how to feel/think about this‚Äù -Wingnut?  Maybe 20 deep breaths and an Exedrin?  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>You know that I worked for Microsoft right? All the babylonjs
 team members here at Microsoft chose to be part of the team and decided
 to dedicate their time to work on the engine.</p>
<p>No one have to be here. Everyone decided to be part of our community.</p>
<p>I found fantastic that they could make a living with the project.
This way they can dedicate full time making sure the project is getting
better. This is how I can make sure that no one is left behind when
there is a bug or a feature requirement.</p>
<p>We all need money to live. I‚Äôm glad this money comes from an activity that involves creating a free tool for all.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I know that you work for MS, but I didn‚Äôt know that you were paid to work on BabylonJS.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt know others were paid to work on BJS, either.  Your ‚Äúsweeps‚Äù
 thru the forum‚Ä¶ happen at coffee-break-time, lunch time, and
late-afternoon, usually.  I THOUGHT it was free-time and break-time
hobby-work, that happened between/around paid MS projects-work.</p>
<p>I dunno.  Microsoft paycheck motivation‚Ä¶ as opposed to
believe-in-the-cause motivation.  Does that feel good/right?  How do we
trust any of these paid helpers‚Ä¶ to help from the heart‚Äôn‚Äôsoul,
instead-of from the wallet or from corporate pressures?</p>
<p>It feels like the fox has been allowed to enter the hen-house.  It
makes me wonder what the name of this ‚Äúteam‚Äù is‚Ä¶ officially.  Does it
have a website?</p>
<p>It makes me wonder how qualified YOUR boss is‚Ä¶ in BJS
operations/history.  How many times does your boss‚Ä¶ order you around, or
 deny a BJS change that a user wanted?</p>
<p>Would you guys even KNOW if you have become puppets to YOUR boss and
your boss‚Äôs boss?  Yes, we could sure use the helpers‚Ä¶ but not the
controlled-type (nuts in a $$$ vise-type) of helpers.</p>
<p>I think it would be wiser to keep the steering committee free-of outside influences.  I think you once believed that way, too.</p>

        <p>Well I don‚Äôt know if you will believe me but I can try at least.</p>
<p>Microsoft decided to pay me to work on babylonjs full-time because
several Microsoft products rely on it. The goal is to make sure to get
fast support and also support a great community project.</p>
<p>I remain the lead and creator of the project. No one is telling me
what to do (besides everyone here when we chat and discuss about options
 and ideas for babylon future) and Microsoft is utterly respectful
towards what we do.</p>
<p>Babylon.js would not be what it is today without  Microsoft help as
it would have been impossible for me to dedicate so much time on
developing the project.</p>
<p>Do you really feel that Microsoft is impacting on anything babylonjs
related? I dunno as you were not even aware that my day job was to work
on babylonjs.</p>
<p>I hope this will help reassuring you.</p>

<p>Did it have an impact on the attempted-to-be-jury-rigged Oimo
setMotor issue?  The words ‚Äúlose time‚Äù and ‚Äúmove on‚Äù came out of your
mouth during my bitch session in that thread.</p>
<p>Is the new whiz kid working on the Oimo setMotor?  Or did someone
suggest he make a ‚ÄúHey look at us GO‚Äù video?  Talk about bad
prioritizing‚Ä¶ holy crap.  We already have a ‚ÄúHey, look at us, ain‚Äôt we
really something‚Äù website.  Do we REALLY need more fluffy feel-good?  Or
 do we need Oimo setMotor working?</p>
<p>What size of team did we have working-on the Oimo problem?  2.4
people.  We couldn‚Äôt get a team together‚Ä¶ because everyone was gathering
 paychecks for doing something else, apparently (seemingly, rushing to
‚Äúship‚Äù 4.0).</p>
<p>You tell me why you used the words ‚Äúlose time‚Äù and ‚Äúmove on‚Äù when
dealing with MY request to get the Oimo setMotor working correctly.</p>
<p>Is JohnK being paid by anyone‚Ä¶ for painstakingly writing AmmoJS docs
because they don‚Äôt exist anywhere else on the planet?  Probably not.   I
 know what will help John.  Let‚Äôs make a ‚ÄúMy, ain‚Äôt we something‚Äù video.
  heh.  Let‚Äôs throw a get-together to pat each other on the backs for
our broken Oimo plugin!  Yeah!  That‚Äôs the ticket to (moral) success
(not).</p>
<p>Just ignore me, DK.  I‚Äôll get over this or something.  I‚Äôm glad you
are still maintaining control over the project, and thank you for the
replies.</p>
<p>More comments welcome. (especially from folks who are NOT influenced by money/corporate-wishes, BJS-wise).</p>

        <p>Oimo problem is not related to bjs so that‚Äôs why I said ‚Äúmove on‚Äù. Nothing else. Nothing related to Microsoft.<br>
Just me saying that this has to be fixed at oimo level.</p>
<p>I hope you gonna get over it and see that nothing changed . On the
contrary if you want my thoughts. Having people dedicated to maintain
the project is just good news for the community because it means more
features, more doc, more demos, etc‚Ä¶</p>

        <p>I like the ‚Äúdedication‚Äù part‚Ä¶ but we are dealing with two
type of motivation behind that dedication, now.  One comes from
believing in BJS, and the other comes from ‚ÄúI gotta feed my kids so I
need to kiss butt‚Äù.</p>
<p>I got the list of ‚ÄúTeam DoItForMoney‚Äù now.  So do the other commune
members.  We now know who answers forum questions because they want to
see noobs advance and be happy, and who answers OR ELSE their kids might
 not eat.</p>
<p>One group‚Ä¶ thorough, detailed answers and attempts to open trails for
 future.  Other group‚Ä¶ cut every corner and remove all unneeded quality‚Ä¶
 to maximize paycheck work-per-time bang-for-buck.</p>
<p>Is that REALLY what you/we hoped-for?  How can we trust Team DoItForMoney?</p>

<p>My team is probably among the bigger believers in helping everyone to
 get better. They do it because they believe in the project. And then
they get paid as MS use babylonjs and want to make sure that it is a
healthy project.  Not the opposite</p>

        <p>Here are my thoughts for what they are worth. There are many
reason I like working with Babylon.js and helping on the forum. Not all
altruistic. It keeps my aging brain from going senile and stops me
watching TV all the time for two and I enjoy it and the satisfaction of
achieving something. If someone turned round and said we will pay you to
 do it I would say thank you very much and take the money. Taking the
money would not make me a lesser friend to BJS. (Don‚Äôt worry I know no
one is going to pay me). I have sought of know for a while that there
was a team working at Microsoft on BJS, nothing direct just odd things I
 read. My feelings are that it is good that a body that has the money to
 do so recognises the value of BJS. Does that make it less pure? Not for
 me.</p>
<p>Did I feel pushed or rushed to finish working on the Oimo setMotor,
not at all as far as I was concerned I had come up with an answer that
had satisfied me. So while recognising your right to feel aggrieved I do
 not feel that way. So there are my comments from a folk who is NOT
influenced by money/corporate-wishes, BJS-wise</p>

<p>Yep‚Ä¶ passion and devotion.  You have it, as do a few others.  I can
tell by the spirit of your/their posts.  And thx for the nice words‚Ä¶
back-atcha, bro.</p>
<p>Also, I get caught-up in seeing others attain a too-rare feeling of
accomplishment, empowerment and self-satisfaction. It‚Äôs a blast‚Ä¶
watching/hearing a noob‚Ä¶ have a happiness overdose‚Ä¶ after 2 hours on
BJS.</p>
<p>But that‚Äôs a different ‚Äúwe‚Äù.</p>
<p>Apparently, some ‚Äúwe‚Äù are here to collect paychecks.  They are going
to claim to be passionate when their boss/paycheck-controller is
watching.  The artificial passion is in their job
requirements/description, so you cannot trust it to be true-blue.</p>
<p>To be frank, they are contaminants (metaphorically-speaking, nothing
personal).  It‚Äôs not their fault that they need to perform a
possibly-fake-passion dog‚Äôn‚Äôpony show‚Ä¶ in order to eat.  That‚Äôs what
capitalists under terrorist threat from cost-of-living‚Ä¶ need to do.
Those of us with FREE and true passion‚Ä¶ are a threat to their jobs.</p>
<p>This commercializing sets-up a huge conflict of interest and promotes
 an US vs. THEM war.  Corporate-controlled government‚Ä¶ vs. ‚Ä¶The People.
 What we thought was a ‚Äúgrass-roots‚Äù effort and project‚Ä¶ is instead‚Ä¶ a
crock of shit‚Ä¶ and can be sold out from under us in the flash of an eye.</p>
<p>All it takes now‚Ä¶ is for MS to offer a couple mil to DK, and BJS is
gone, along with all the passion and excitement we have poured into it.
 The commune is under attack, and I don‚Äôt think DK and his
paid-to-parade minions‚Ä¶ have enough
life-experience/capitalism-experience to see it or admit it.  All we‚Äôre
going to get from them is ‚Äúnuh uh‚Äù denials.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll see.  If ANY of them says ‚ÄúLarry‚Ä¶ I DO SEE what you‚Äôre saying
and why you are saying it‚Äù‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll know.  Sure, maybe nothing can be done
 about it, and maybe it‚Äôs unavoidable to hire servants.  But let‚Äôs see
if ANYONE even understands what i am saying/claiming, or if it‚Äôs just a
‚Äúnuh uh‚Äù denial festival.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs see if they can offer a viable defense of my claims.  I doubt
they can.  They just don‚Äôt know enough about the hazards of doing things
 for money - causing something that was once ‚Äúclean‚Äù‚Ä¶ to go dirty.  They
 have never compared an Amish-made shovel‚Ä¶ to a Walmart shovel, or they
just won‚Äôt admit the differences, even if they COULD see them.  ‚Äúnuh
uh‚Äù.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a sad day.  Bacteria got onto something I love.  I‚Äôd rather
shrink the popularity of BJS‚Ä¶ until the true-blues/volunteers CAN handle
 the workload‚Ä¶ without hired guns.  Safer.</p>
<p>Currently, corporate-sponsored, moderator-level ‚Äústeering patrols‚Äù
are roaming the streets of Lake Babylon.  They claim to have OUR best
interests in mind.  Maybe it‚Äôs someone else‚Äô best interests‚Ä¶ in wallet.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/deltakosh">@Deltakosh</a>
 - Is there any chance you could tell us ALL, HERE, ‚Ä¶ the names of YOUR
boss and THEIR boss?  thx.  I‚Äôd like to add them to the new list of
names. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not private information.</p>

        <p>Hi M.  Thx for the comments.  Yeah‚Ä¶ some of us (people like

        <p>Funnily I‚Äôm paid by Microsoft to work on Babylon.js since
more than 2 years and I never made that secret. So no need for a line of
 defense.  It seems to work pretty well and until now no one complained
about that because it is unrelated.</p>
<p>Babylon.js is and will always be a community project. This will be my

        <p>I love the fact that you are expressing all your opinions in
such a passionate way but I do not think it is of any interest to insult
 people as you do here. You can disagree, feel scared and so on but
insulting us will not add any constructive thinking to the discussion.</p>
<p>You ask to provide a viable defense but you would not trust anything coming from <strong>‚Äúcontanimants servants paid-to-parade minions with possibly-fake-passion dog‚Äôn‚Äôpony show‚Äù</strong> so I am not sure it would be of any help to continue.</p>
<p>Telling you I love working on Babylon could be seen as fake passion,
speaking about all the work I do outside my day job for the community
could be seen as trying to get more money and it will always be easy to
come back from anything we could say to the money aspect. But do you
think that if it was only for money I would even take the time to answer
 ? Do you think that my frustration and anger regarding your message
would be that high if it was not linked to true passion ? Probably not‚Ä¶
but I hope you ll see it over time through the help and features we ll
provide to the community.</p>
<p>PS: I love Minions:<br>

<blockquote>
<p>insulting us will not add any constructive thinking to the discussion</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Wow, if you feel insulted after THIS gentle level of investigation
into potential deception, then you‚Äôre not ready for round 2 AT ALL, are
ya?</p>
<p>Of course you‚Äôre not going to have a defense.  I think you made a good step‚Ä¶ by not bothering to attempt one.</p>
<p>Take note that it is ‚Äúcontaminants‚Äù‚Ä¶ you should look-it-up and see if
 you understand why that term applies to paid helpers.  Tell me you see
the correlation.</p>
<p>AND, I said POSSIBLY-fake.  The commune will not be able to determine
 whether fake or not‚Ä¶ never ever again.  You (or any ‚Äúpaid‚Äù) could be
driven by wallet.  We no longer know your goals and we no longer know if
 you are a MS ‚Äúplant‚Äù or not.  There is no longer ANY way‚Ä¶ to know what
drives your passion.</p>
<p>Look at that fact‚Ä¶ from MY angle.  Just put yourself in a TRUE
DEVOTEE‚Äôs shoes.  Do you see why I call paid helpers‚Ä¶ a contaminant,
yet?</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt trust you to ever work a bug with me.  You‚Äôd quit working on it‚Ä¶ at capitalism quitting time.</p>
<p>None of you came running to join the Oimo setMotor issue‚Ä¶ because it
wasn‚Äôt an assigned task by your boss.  None of you were authorized to
put hours into it‚Ä¶ and so‚Ä¶ none/few of you did.</p>
<p>OMG, I understand DK‚Äôs pinging, now.  When he pings, he‚Äôs assigning
tasks to worker-bees.  Yuh yuh yuh, I should have seen THAT, long ago.
God am I dumb.</p>
<p>Aside:  It‚Äôs a plugin problem, not an Oimo lib problem.   If it IS a  lib problem, its because we hacked the lib.</p>
<p>But the workers were/are under ‚Äúwork-orders‚Äù to do something else‚Ä¶
like get 4.0 ready to ‚Äúship‚Äù even though the Oimo plugin doesn‚Äôt work
right.</p>
<p>Yep, that makes sense now.  The ‚Äúpaids‚Äù hadn‚Äôt been work-ordered to
work-on the plugin‚Ä¶ and so they won‚Äôt.  They are controlled.  They are
TOLD when/where to help, and any deviation from orders‚Ä¶ is dangerous to
the wallet.</p>
<p>How would you expect we ‚Äúpures‚Äù to react to learning about the
existence of ‚Äúpaids‚Äù?  What kind of reaction to that deception/trouble‚Ä¶
would you have expected?</p>

        <p>I may not have been explicit enough in the past so let me at least use that thread to be clearer:</p>
<p>The team here at Microsoft is composed (so far as we are recruiting.
And no this is not another secret because I created sometimes ago a post
 for it in this very forum but apparently it was not enough) of these
good guys:<br>

<p>The name of the team is Babylon.js and we are focusing on supporting Babylon.js project and the gltf ecosystem</p>
<p>The team was created in in May 2017 (<a href="https://twitter.com/deltakosh/status/855257878088658944?s=19" class="inline-onebox" rel="nofollow noopener">David
 Catuhe on Twitter: "What a day :) On 5/1, I'll move to "3D for
everyone" team at Microsoftto lead our 3D for the Web strategy with
#babylonjs"</a>)</p>
<p>The creation of that team was obviously a good thing that I announced
 on my Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. No secret agenda or conspiracy</p>
<p>The governance of the project is dicted by this policy: <a href="https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/contributing.md" class="inline-onebox" rel="nofollow noopener">Babylon.js/contributing.md at master ¬∑ BabylonJS/Babylon.js ¬∑ GitHub</a></p>
<p>That‚Äôs it.</p>
<p>For the sake of it, I gathered some links where (in the old forum) I
was mentioning that Microsoft was actively supporting the project:</p>

 I completely understand your concerns that there may be people in the
community paid to be here while seeming like they are here because they
want to be. In today‚Äôs age of anonymity and misdirection in social
media, finding out people who you thought were one thing and are
secretly another can be very unsettling. It‚Äôs to that end that I
purposely use my real name as my forum alias, my twitter handle, and
list right on my LinkedIn page that I work for Microsoft and work
directly on Babylon.js and glTF. I started using LinkedIn long before
Microsoft acquired it so please don‚Äôt read that as me shilling another
Microsoft product, just a point of clarity that you can find me without a
 ton of work (other than the common name). Again, just for transparency,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcryan/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcryan/</a><br>

<p>But I wanted to take some time after reading your thread to digest
what you spoke about and join the conversation with my experience with
Babylon.js. I‚Äôm not here to tell you what to think or feel about
anything, just to give you another data point for consideration as you
think through your frustration.</p>
<p>I am, oddly enough, the oldest member of the team and am in my second
 iteration of career path, starting in graphic design and photography
and transitioning to game art and real-time rendering. I‚Äôve worked for
small companies and large, for profit and not-for-profit, and I can say
one thing in all that experience‚Ä¶ all companies care about staying
relevant and solvent and the successful ones realize they also have to
care about the well being of their employees. When I switched from the
not-for-profit world to Microsoft, starting over from the bottom of the
ladder, I also worried that a giant like Microsoft may treat me as a cog
 in the machine which leads to employees only doing what they have to
for the paycheck. And I was starting out as a contractor, so they didn‚Äôt
 have to invest in me as a long term employee so I thought that fear may
 be easily realized.</p>
<p>What I found was a team that was passionate about what they were
creating, which was HoloLens. We all put in extra hours because we
wanted to. I found support and encouragement, as the oldest guy in the
room in the contract position, to develop and grow my skills and own
what I was passionate about. Our broader team had five pillars that I
continue to live by today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create without fear</li>
<li>Be curious and keep learning</li>
<li>Lead by doing</li>
<li>Tell great stories</li>
<li>We stand together</li>
</ul>
<p>I found that Microsoft cares about its employees, its community, and
its impact in the world. I found a company who pays their employees a
good wage and encourages them to give back to causes and charities that
are important to them. <a href="http://www.technologyrecord.com/Article/microsofts-employee-giving-programme-raises-us125-million-51598" rel="nofollow noopener">This article is a little older,</a> but the sentiment is the same today.</p>
<p>I have worked with some great teams at Microsoft and when I was first
 exposed to Babylon.js I was working for another team and asked to help
out with some demos that Babylon.js needed. What I found was a small and
 scrappy team of engineers who were more than passionate about the
project they built‚Ä¶ they were committed to making it everything they
dreamed it could be. As I helped them outside of my regular work on my
team, I saw in them a joy in coming to the office every day and a
disbelief that they could work on this project full time rather than
finding time outside work to push it forward. There wasn‚Äôt someone
telling them how to pivot the project to make money or what features
they needed to make. They treated every person or entity using
Babylon.js as a part of the community whose voice mattered. Whether that
 is a student learning the engine for the first time, a small team
making their first WebGL game, a group in Microsoft using the engine to
make their project better, or any other software giant who is
collaborating with us on Babylon.js and glTF, everyone has equal
footing.</p>
<p>I decided that this was the team I wanted to join and it wasn‚Äôt
because there was an opening on a job board. My job on this team didn‚Äôt
exist when I decided that working on Babylon.js was something I wanted
to spend my days doing. I made a case for why my expertise would benefit
 the team and the engine and we were able to convince our organization
to move my position permanently to the Babylon.js team.</p>
<p>I can tell you that of all of the good teams I‚Äôve worked with, this
one is the best. The members of the team truly take ownership of the
work they do and they aren‚Äôt doing it because someone told them to. Most
 every team meeting we have is filled with ‚ÄúI think this would be good
for the engine and community and so I‚Äôm going after it.‚Äù I‚Äôve never
witnessed any ‚Äúwe have to do this because our bosses are making us‚Äù
projects. And I see every member of the team putting in time after
hours, on weekends, while they are on vacation, etc. not because they
are getting paid to do so but because it‚Äôs important to them that
something is done or they want to make sure a community member is
unblocked.</p>
<p>For me personally, I get ‚Äúpinged‚Äù because <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/deltakosh">@Deltakosh</a>
 is the most present on our forums and always sees issues first and he
wants to make sure that I see that someone needs my help. And I hope you
 can see from my contributions to the forum that this is something I can
 spend hours doing for a thread. Responding to and helping the community
 is always something I do first, before my other work, to make sure that
 our community members are not blocked by a lack of information. And
often times the topics I cover go beyond the boundaries of Babylon.js
into creation of assets and how to accomplish tasks that are covered
elsewhere in other forums. I could just push our community to other
forums with their DCC tool questions, but I feel it‚Äôs important that we
help them in all aspects of their project. I have even spent time on
Skype calls with community members speaking directly to them to help
them understand issues or getting feedback from them.</p>
<p>And when the end of the day rolls around and I haven‚Äôt gotten to the
tasks I wanted to accomplish for the day, I stay late. Or I pick up once
 I get home. Or I work over the weekend. Not because I am being paid to
do it, but because I want to push our work to a high bar and that
requires sacrifice. I can‚Äôt tell you the number of times I‚Äôve worked 20
hour days 7 days a week to get a project ready. And it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm
 being paid to‚Ä¶ I get paid the same no matter how many extra hours I put
 in. And it‚Äôs not because my boss told me to. <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/deltakosh">@Deltakosh</a>
 is my boss and he actively tells me not to put in those kinds of hours.
 And I commute between 5 and 6 hours a day to come to the office and
work with this team. None of that I do because I am punching a time card
 for my paycheck.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, I earn a living so I can put a roof over my
family‚Äôs heads and provide what they need. I could do that anywhere, and
 I have had companies pursue me to bring my expertise to their work.
However, I choose to be on the Babylon.js team for the people and the
project. I feel ownership over what I put into the project like I hope
everyone who is part of the community does. Because my paycheck comes
from doing work I love is not something to be ashamed of, it‚Äôs something
 I hope everyone is able to do.</p>
<p>Like I said in the beginning, I understand your distrust of corporate
 intentions and I have shared some of them in the past. But I hope that
hearing of my experience on this team and with this project does give
you some insight into at least one of the people who is here working
every day to make Babylon.js everything that we think it can be. I can
tell you that this is one of the most rewarding experiences I‚Äôve had in
my career and I can‚Äôt ask for a better group of people to share my days
with. The passion, expertise, intelligence, support, and genuine
goodness of the group I get to work with is not only something I hope I
am always able to experience in my career, but it‚Äôs also something that I
 hope everyone does.</p>

<p>Last time I looked at it, I saw it was switchable on a person by

would see it, but all the people are not listed together.  There are a

        <p><a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/patrickryan">@PatrickRyan</a> ‚Ä¶ thanks for that considerate response.  If something good <em>could</em> be said about this situation, that was probably just about right.  I hope to gosh that you are not buffalo‚Äôd/bedazzled.</p>
<p>You guys are in the hot-seat of a technology that is much bigger and
more future-impacting than most can imagine.  And, whether you wish it
or not, MS corporate futurists WILL notice the coming 3d trends.  Just
in the AR sunglasses dept alone‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre talking $$ billions $$ of
‚Äúinfluence-BJS‚Äù forces.</p>
<p>I really hope you try to instill integrity in each other, and hold
your intestinal fortitude ground‚Ä¶ when those forces come a-influencing.
 I fear you won‚Äôt be able to, because when corporate throws the switch,
you‚Äôre going to be surrounded by 100+ more people, including ‚Äústeerers‚Äù‚Ä¶
 and ya‚Äôll will get caught-up in the $$ excitement $$.</p>
<p>Man, even if you guys were a separate company, and only
sub-contracting with MS‚Ä¶ that would get you out from under that dreaded
overpowered MS umbrella.  Do you guys realize how powerful that thing
is?  Do you know how much unmitigated money that they can throw at
things?  You guys are sailing in dangerous waters, and you are in the
future-aiming cross-hairs of the corporate boat-changing cannon.</p>
<p>If MS ‚Äúturns on‚Äù in the 3D dept, and it‚Äôs almost a sure-thing that
they will, I think you are destined for a big surprise.  You might not
even know what hit you.  Please maintain your integrity.  Thank you for
your tactful comments and reassurances, PR.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the reassurance attempts by others, too.  I DO
notice them.  I‚Äôm just scared that the situation could change at the
drop of a hat.  Deltakosh‚Äôs boss (and all bosses above) now has ‚Äúa say‚Äù
about BabylonJS, and can put DK into/under a ‚Äúdo it OR ELSE you‚Äôre
fired/terminated‚Äù (loving terms, eh?) ultimatum.</p>
<p>DK assures me that it hasn‚Äôt happened‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt
 ever happen.  If it does happen, and DK personally dislikes the
direction that corporate is OR-ELSING him to go, will his paycheck win,
or will BJS win?</p>
<p>Dangerous waters.  It is quite likely‚Ä¶ that DK‚Äôs paycheck will win
that decision.  The caps have him ‚Äúover a barrel‚Äù, and BJS‚Äôs nuts are
now firmly clamped in a monetary vise.  The BJS ‚Äúaffiliation with
Microsoft‚Äù DOES now exist, DK‚Ä¶ whether you agree or not.  I hope someday
 you see what you‚Äôve done.  The Microsoft financial backing may
initially look nice and innocent, but it has fangs that can kill you
with little hesitation.</p>
<p>Main thing is‚Ä¶ it is exposed now.  BJS users have been warned, at
least SOME of them.  Hopefully the news of the dangers‚Ä¶ will spread, and
 BJS users can cover their butts.  What a shame this had to happen.</p>
<p>BJS now has the potential to become the Walmart shovel‚Ä¶ breaks 2 days
 after first-use‚Ä¶ due to caps removing quality to maximize profits,
un-repairable, no parts available, lands in the dump on day 3.   It‚Äôs
what caps do.  They/It harvest/mow crop-portunities SO LOW/SHORT‚Ä¶ that
their harvester blades chop the dirt.</p>
<p>A little note to capitalism:  I hate you, capitalism, and your
terrorist invention‚Ä¶ cost-of-living.  I WILL get a cease‚Äôn‚Äôdesist order
against you‚Ä¶ for monetary discrimination, domestic terrorism, and felony
 extortion.  Count on it.  You have ruined enough things that I love.
(How‚Äôs that for on-topic off-topic?)</p>
<p>I also appreciate being allowed freedom-of-speech‚Ä¶ in this freedom-of-speech, no-topic-police thread.</p>

        <p><strong>In an alternative universe</strong></p>
<p>Ningwut, I was as shocked as you were to find that KD and the core
team just look after BJS as a hobby for free! We are using BJS in a
major project and now find that it run by a bunch of hippy do-gooders.
In my life time my interests have changed from fishing, to skiing and to
 motor cars. What‚Äôs to stop this lot from doing the same where would
that leave our last three years work? Even worse what if its some
ideological plot, draw us into using BJS then find we can only carry on
using it if we subscribe to their utopian nightmare.</p>
<p>With no formal support structure if KD leaves or changes his mind
after some deeply meaningful ‚Äòtrip‚Äô there will be no structure to
appoint someone else in his place to ensure that BJS carries on with the
 same ethos as it has now. Main thing is‚Ä¶ it is exposed now. BJS users
have been warned, at least SOME of them. Hopefully the news of the
dangers‚Ä¶ will spread, and BJS users can cover their butts. What a shame
this had to happen.</p>
<p>Now we know that the core team are part of ‚Äòthe other‚Äô we can keep an
 eye on them to check what they are upto, cannot let hippy do-gooders
get a grip. As my old Gran used to say ‚ÄúAll the world‚Äôs dangerous except
 me and thee, and I am not too sure about thee.‚Äù</p>
<p>Keep the good fight, KohnJ</p>

        <p>Cute.  But you don‚Äôt need an alternative universe.  Just
remove the tumor call capitalism‚Ä¶ that grew on your (‚Äúyour‚Äù != own-able,
 though, not even little pieces of it) planet in THIS universe.
Capitalism is a man-made thing‚Ä¶ its founders long-ago dead of old age.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a church of competing and a con/sham‚Ä¶ not part of ‚Äúlife‚Äù and not
 ‚Äújust the way it is‚Äù (self-lies/blinders I hear often from
belly-ups/buy-ins).  Essentially, it is AmWay (American Way).
Capitalism is the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> world problem, having
killed millions (and still killing) via attrition.  It uses the world‚Äôs
most powerful terrorizing device - ‚Äúcost of living‚Äù.</p>
<p>Just remember that‚Ä¶ in ‚Äúthis world‚Äù, ONLY capitalism volunteer/forced
 joiners‚Ä¶ use economies and/or do tug-o-warring over paper false-idols
(money) and over paper false-empowerments (entitles of ownership).  ONLY
 capitalists!</p>
<p>ALL other living creatures on the entire planet‚Ä¶ (in THIS
world/universe)‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt use money, don‚Äôt honor/use ownership, don‚Äôt use
locks, don‚Äôt witness widespread servitude/OR-ELSING, and don‚Äôt put
blockades called price tags on survival supplies.  AND, they don‚Äôt fill
up their dumps with badly-made, non-repairable crap products.</p>
<p>You never have to worry about a hippy do-gooder.  They would NEVER
participate in the US vs. THEM wars over false idols.  They want to
love/adopt one another (commune-ity), not bill each other to death.
Hippy do-gooders treat fellow humans‚Ä¶ like they treat their pets‚Ä¶ well
hugged, well fed, good health, nice shelter, and regarded as their best
friend.</p>
<p>With love, standing BESIDE the pyramid scheme that capitalists built
and condone and somehow joined‚Ä¶ standing with all the other
non-economy-using creatures of THIS WORLD, laughing at the caps and
their crushing-its-foundation, rat-racing, get-a-leg-up, orders-barking,
 people-stacking structure that they cheer-for‚Ä¶</p>

Missing Babylon.GUI class‚Ä¶ in 4.0.0.0 ‚Ä¶<br>
So i couldnt build the gui anymore i wanted to rewind to 3.3 but i was tired, looking for answers.<br>
Im kind of super bizzy nowadays, and have patience maybe it is fixed in the future?!<br>
The plus with babylonjs is i can theoretically make dungeon crawler and
have people play it in the browser on my website that is why i liked it
so much in the beginning‚Ä¶<br>
later problem was more like future with install free interfaces etx I like it much<br>
But i think Babylonjs has alot to keep up with rn.</p>

<p>March 7th publishing date on the video.  They made that video to
counter-act my tough-love brutal truths.  Coooool.  They might have even
 put-in some weekend hours!  (Wingy faints.)</p>
<p>‚ÄúTrust in BabylonJS Inc, because WE say you should.‚Äù  Yeah, it is
just like the commercials from the ‚Äúbig boys‚Äù of mercantilism.
Impressive, but would have been MORE powerful if each team member was
cuddling a puppy.</p>
<p>We know, though.  Community is not first.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Paychecks are first, because they can take the food and well-being from your families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BJS comes second, because the program is also important and should be corporate-influence-free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third‚Ä¶ is likely personal convictions of paid team members - what
THEY believe, what THEY want to happen (with possible aspirations of
expansion that leads to bigger paychecks and less paycheck-threat).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community MIGHT get this 4th slot.  YAY!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is propaganda, but I‚Äôm honored and impressed that ya‚Äôll are trying
 to escape the crosses that you‚Äôve been nailed-to.  It‚Äôs good to see
your Redmond-owned faces.</p>
<p>Really, you have two distrust issues at-hand.</p>
<ol>
<li>The integrity and devotion of the paids.</li>
<li>BJS being under the ‚Äúchange it or else you‚Äôre fired‚Äù MS empowerment over Deltakosh.</li>
</ol>
<p>For <span class="hashtag">#1</span>‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any hope.
 Their paychecks are more important than anything else‚Ä¶ because of the
cost-of-living terrorism threat upon them.  It‚Äôs not their fault or
anything‚Ä¶ it just is.  Their ancestors didn‚Äôt destroy the wage-slavery
system/competer‚Äôs church‚Ä¶ back when it was smaller and less bought-into.
  And so, these guys were born-into wage-slavery, unless they were born
set-for-life as the child of a powerful profiteer.</p>
<p>Born-set-for-life folks‚Ä¶ are real rare, as we all know.  None of the
paids are set-for-life‚Äôs, or else they wouldn‚Äôt be suckling from a
Microsoft-owned feeding-nipple.</p>
<p>Now, <span class="hashtag">#2</span>‚Ä¶ is going to take a signed and
legal letter from Willie Gates‚Ä¶ showing us a promise of ‚Äúhands off BJS‚Äù
and ‚Äúno OR ELSE threatening its lead author or its team‚Äù.  But even that
 can‚Äôt be trusted, because of Willie‚Äôs freedom to ‚Äúchange his mind‚Äù
(reverse gear).  Nobody is going to legally bind his ass‚Ä¶ to ANYTHING.
With the power of HIS lawyers‚Ä¶ nothing will stick.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMicroSoft BabyonJS - a name YOU can TRUST for YOUR entire family!‚Äù
heh.  What a video.  heh.  Edit-in a few pieces of puppies, hot dogs,
apple pies, and chevrolet‚Äôs‚Ä¶ maybe some laughing babies‚Ä¶ and then ya got
 a REAL piece of propaganda pablum.</p>
<p>It would interesting to know if any of the paids‚Ä¶ objected to the reason-for/making-of the video.</p>
<p>Well my fellow pures, the ‚Äútheys‚Äù are definitely scrambling to wipe
the poop from their browned reputations.  This is good.  But they were
probably ‚Äúordered‚Äù to participate in the video.  Ordering and fulfilling
 orders‚Ä¶ is what a corporation does.  If you want some competer‚Äôs church
 coupons, you WILL march to the beat of the boss‚Äôs drums and ‚Äústay
in-line‚Äù and ‚Äúunder control‚Äù.</p>
<p>We all know the power of OR ELSE (extortion).  It is the creed of
capitalist parents when they nest-kick their kids into ‚Äúout there‚Äù land.
  All the way thru childhood‚Ä¶ the policy is share share share.  At age
18, 180-degree policy-reversal to fight fight fight.  Puts the kids in
utter shock.  Want a girlfriend?  Want a car?  Want a home?  Want
enjoyments?  Want low-stress from attacking cost-of-living
survival-supplies terrorism?  Better march for the church‚Ä¶ do its
bidding‚Ä¶ stay in-line and under-control, or else.</p>
<p>And ONLY AmWay free-marketeers coupons are accepted in Amway
survival-supply stores.  Only FM greenbacks allowed.  No competition
allowed in ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite type of money?‚Äù.  Only capitalist
greenbacks are accepted as ‚Äúlegal tender‚Äù.  No Lutheran redbacks, no
Catholic bluebacks, no Kiwanis Club orangebacks, no Uncle Wingy‚Äôs
purplebacks.  The free-marketeers got the ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù on the type of
coupons allowed in survival supply stores‚Ä¶ used to surmount the
blockades/locks called price tags (a capitalism-invented thing).</p>
<p>Sweet control mechanism, eh?  They got that ‚Äúlegal tender‚Äù division‚Ä¶ well tied-up‚Ä¶ nuts in vise.</p>
<p>Gosh I wish Willie would read this and own-up to how very correct I
am, about the whole situation.  Maybe I would get a louder microphone‚Ä¶
and with his help, perhaps we could get this mess cleaned-up, worldwide.
  Let‚Äôs see if Mr. Gates really cares about community‚Ä¶ and posts some
promises and assurances here‚Ä¶ in TWC.  Let‚Äôs see how much MS cares about
 community concerns, because this is a fine one to test-upon.  ymmv.</p>
<p>This might get interesting, now that the paids have raised a shield.
 This whole situation is definitely going to make the paids think a bit
more about being as clean as they can be‚Ä¶ while operating in a sewer.</p>
<p>We MIGHT even get some protection for DK‚Ä¶ from MS OR ELSE-ing his
paycheck.  But a promise from Willie Gates‚Ä¶ is not easy to get, and
likely that dam would NOT hold-back very much ‚Äúlegal water‚Äù.  Willie can
 change his mind‚Ä¶ and that option will be included in any
letter-of-promise that we little-pure folk could EVER get.  We haven‚Äôt
got much hope‚Ä¶ against that kind of power/influence.</p>
<p>So, here we are‚Ä¶ stuck in limbo.  What will a super-fan do‚Ä¶ now that
BJS Inc is happening?  I dunno, but that‚Äôs MY problem.  MS put its big
fat foot down‚Ä¶ right between me and my MANY BJS friends/acquaintances.
All I really want to do‚Ä¶ is light that foot on-fire and celebrate its
crumble-to-ashes.  Be well, guys.  Interesting video!</p>

<p>I really don‚Äôt like being the prick that I am currently being.  If
you look carefully, I have a problem with a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù and not with
people.  I HAVE TO remove the make-up and nylons and lipstick that
capitalism has adorned-itself-with‚Ä¶ before ya‚Äôll can see the situation
that you‚Äôve gotten yourselves into.</p>
<p>I HAVE TO peel-off the self-bullshitting, and push your noses into the dog poop piles that you created.</p>
<p>Sure, you‚Äôre not going to get this kind of reaction from other BJS
users.  They‚Äôre barely awake and they‚Äôre marching-away for the church of
 competing‚Ä¶ being good little ‚Äúdo as you‚Äôre toads‚Äù.  Ya got no critical
thinkers like me‚Ä¶ laying around here.  Even if ya did, they wouldn‚Äôt
voice it on the forum, due to the fears imposed by topic-police (thank
goodness there are few/no topic police nearby).</p>
<p>I guess‚Ä¶ maybe‚Ä¶ this is not a place for anti-capitalism-ists.  If I may quote a PM from <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/jerome">@jerome</a> without his permission‚Ä¶ he loosely called this rant‚Ä¶ ‚Äúa philosophical necessity‚Äù.  Yep, that‚Äôs exactly what it is.</p>
<p>The problem isn‚Äôt solved, but it‚Äôs PLENTY defined, yes?  Not sure, though, as I am getting <em>some</em>
 PM‚Äôs that say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand‚Äù.  I guess‚Ä¶ users‚Ä¶ feel free to ask
me questions about what this is and why it is necessary.  It is VERY
MUCH like a ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want your stinky factory in our town‚Äù protest.
Try to keep smiling‚Ä¶ this is a battle of principles.</p>

        <p>Hi again.  Since this series of posts has seemingly evolved
into ‚Äúteach a capitalist how to investigate what they joined‚Äù‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs
talk about ownership.</p>
<p>First, take notice of how many times USA folk say ‚Äúmy‚Äù.  My kids, my
house, my husband, my car, my lawyer, my doctor, my divorce, my family,
my yard, my state, my country.  EVERY SINGLE USAGE of ‚Äúmy‚Äù‚Ä¶ CAN and
SHOULD be replaced with ‚Äúthis‚Äù or ‚Äúthe‚Äù.  To quickly sum the reason for
this ‚Äúmy my my addiction‚Äù, it is because owning things‚Ä¶ is empowerment,
and USA folks are nearly empowerments-starved-to-death.  It might be
better or worse in other countries.  I just haven‚Äôt been allowed to
study those other countries and cultures.</p>
<p>Possibly, it is worst in the USA‚Ä¶ because its people are SO VERY
CLOSE-TO having empowerment, and yet so very far away.  Almost all news
commenting‚Ä¶ is blocked by ‚Äúregister‚Äù and ‚Äúlogin‚Äù or join FacePlant or
Twittles.  Americans REALLY REALLY want their controllers to hear their
words, but the sheer thickness of the dark clouds that control us‚Ä¶ make
them nearly impenetrable.  Thick bureaucracy!  It is almost impossible
to get a channel/message to the sun.  (It is probably similarly
impossible to get a message/channel/audience with laying-in-the-sun
Willie Gates).  <img src="twc8_e2_files/smiley.png" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Ownership‚Ä¶ what is it?  Is it legal?</p>
<p>If you haven‚Äôt noticed by now, ALL items on this planet‚Ä¶ all
manufactured items, all constructed items, all food and lifeforms, are
made from ‚ÄúEarth materials‚Äù.  EVERY SINGLE ITEM on the planet‚Ä¶ is made
of Earth materials.</p>
<p>Now I am not an expert in ownership laws, but I am quite sure that
the original creators/owners of ANYTHING (including Earth materials)
MUST BE consulted, and legal permission given, before ANYTHING can be
deemed own-able/en-title-able.  Original owners MUST be consulted and
permissions given.</p>
<p>Was ANYONE given permission by the creators of Earth materials‚Ä¶ to
wrap a border around an area of the planet, and claim it to be ‚Äúowned‚Äù
by a ‚Äúgroup‚Äù? (<a href="http://somenation.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">somenation.org</a>)</p>
<p>Was anyone given permission to claim ownership-empowerment over ANY ‚Äúsynthesized-from-Earth-materials‚Äù item?</p>
<p>No.  The LEGAL truth is‚Ä¶ NOTHING can be owned.  NOTHING is a
my-my-my.  I don‚Äôt care if we have wedged illegal ownership laws onto
the USA‚Äôs law-books or not, those laws are null and void.  Nobody
consulted the original owners of Earth materials‚Ä¶ to find out if
anything COULD be owned.</p>
<p>The self-lies that the caps are doing‚Ä¶ regarding ownership,
bordering/fencing lands, denying people survival supplies unless they
have free-marketeer/AmWay coupons (money)‚Ä¶ is nothing short of
disgusting.</p>
<p>Now go have YOUR cup of coffee, or YOUR lunch-break, or YOUR
cigarette, and YOUR morning doughnut, at YOUR job for YOUR paycheck,
which you need in ‚Äúorder‚Äù to buy some more YOUR stuff, and think about
the giant lie that you have bought-into - the lie of ownership.  That
propaganda/lie has been blatantly shoved down your throats and crammed
up your butts, because without it, capitalism‚Äôs ‚Äúordering systems‚Äù
cannot operate what-so-ever.</p>
<p>I wonder if Dk ever refers to HIS team as‚Ä¶ MY guys‚Ä¶ MY team‚Ä¶ MY people.  hmm.</p>
<p>(I‚Äôm just waiting-around while MY mechanic fixes the tire on MY
Hippy-Do-Gooder Anti-Capitalism Roadshow tour bus.  I will be coming to
YOUR town‚Ä¶ as soon as I somehow gather enough free-marketeering coupons
to satisfy MY tire-repair mechanic.)  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Hi Wingnut,</p>
<p>Very interesting assessment! The debate over the nature and validity of private property is actually one of <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/comm.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">the</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_property" rel="nofollow noopener">oldest</a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3066.htm#article1" rel="nofollow noopener">discourses</a> <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/mitsis/papers/stoicspropertypolitics.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">in</a> <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/aristotles-politics/summaries/book2" rel="nofollow noopener">western</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)" rel="nofollow noopener">philosophy</a>.
 (I‚Äôm guessing non-western philosophers tackled this too; I‚Äôm just not
as familiar with that history, unfortunately.) A lot of different

<p>Neither was I sure so spent some time having a go and came up with a

        <p>Hey, thanks for the links.  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3066.htm#article1" rel="nofollow noopener">This link</a>
 you provided‚Ä¶ feels really nice to me, but it‚Äôs packed-up with too much
 ‚ÄúJesus stuff‚Äù for my tastes.  I wish the same analysis existed, but
from the hippy tree-hugger, deer-hugger, bug-hugger, people-hugger
perspective.  My tiny group of anti-caps don‚Äôt care about HOW ownership
should work.  We just want it eliminated, and know that is the
good‚Äôn‚Äôright step.  If the mosquitoes and birds and deer and trees
aren‚Äôt using ownership, humans shouldn‚Äôt use it either.  Stay natural.</p>
<p>Anyone who has spent ANY serious time in the forests‚Ä¶ knows there is a
 ‚Äúspirit‚Äù there, and it ‚Äúsure-as-hell‚Äù hasn‚Äôt shown to be any-what
related to any mainstream religions.  Yet its ‚Äúvoice‚Äù is much louder
than any Bible-thumping pulpit-camping preacher.</p>
<p>I think ‚Äúcustodianship‚Äù and ‚Äústewardship‚Äù are VERY NEEDED, as we move
 forward‚Ä¶ lifting the caps‚Äô faces from ‚Äúthe snort‚Äù piles.  These
terms/roles - Custodianship and Stewardship (call them C&amp;S ?)‚Ä¶ DO
NOT allow the blockading of those resources‚Ä¶ from others.  C&amp;S DOES
allow the temporary blockading of those who intend to DAMAGE the item
being cared-for.  Laws would still exist‚Ä¶ for Team Earth resources (all
Earth things, living or inanimate).  The police division of Team Earth‚Äôs
 all-volunteer work-forces‚Ä¶ WILL enforce STRICT laws about damaging an
Earth resource.</p>
<p>This is because the capitalists will have FINALLY LEARNED the same
thing that the USA military has learned LONG AGO:  To hurt ONE member of
 ‚Äúteam‚Äù‚Ä¶ hurts ALL of ‚Äúteam‚Äù.  (I was active duty U.S. Air Force from
1976-1985).  I loved it.  It was a commune‚Ä¶ and we all took care of one
another‚Ä¶ central team‚Ä¶ altruists‚Ä¶ watching -out for the other guy first,
 and then checking on self‚Ä¶ later.  Capitalists, being programmed to be
competers‚Ä¶ have almost no concept of ‚Äúother person first‚Äù unless you are
 talking about their nation-unto-selves household (the emBANKed
fortification they use in the US/THEM, BUYER/SELLER wars‚Ä¶ that they
fight with each other out in the cow pasture.)</p>
<p>Side Note:  Capitalists WILL place a fellow ‚Äúus‚Äù above themselves.
The other person MUST be labeled as an ‚Äúus‚Äù (like a family member)‚Ä¶ and
it helps if that other person is located/labeled-as ‚Äúin here‚Äù.  ‚ÄúOut
there‚Äù and ‚Äúthems‚Äù are rarely cared-for before/above a capitalist
competer.  Competing does not work that way.  Them‚Äôs are harvested
without remorse.  Harvest, or BE harvested, ya know?  When a cap is
asked about the well-being of people on the other side of a capitalist‚Äôs
 yard-fence/blinders-fence, they often answer ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my job‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs
 not my problem‚Äù.</p>
<hr>
<p>I could tell you a very sad story about how MANY MANY children
decided to leave the centralized farm house and centralized feed-bowl of
 well-being therein.  They were lured out of the house by ‚Äúbling‚Äù and
empowerments-luring‚Ä¶ and by the seeking of ‚Äúbeing normal‚Äù.  They pitched
 their nation-unto-selves (family-unto-selves?) pup-tents‚Ä¶ out in the
cow pasture‚Ä¶ and started the US vs. THEM wars and tug-o-warring
festival.  The false idol wars.</p>
<p>They haven‚Äôt returned to the central farmhouse yet, and gramma is
REAL WORRIED, and the pasture is getting bloody from their intense
tug-o-warring games.  They are SO SO deluded.  It‚Äôs embarrassing,
disgusting‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ so sad.  It makes gramma cry a lot.</p>
<hr>
<p>Economies suffer from a thing I call spirography‚Ä¶ (what goes around,
comes around).  Remember spirographs? No matter which way you would
start rotating the gears/pen, the pen would ALWAYS, eventually, return
to its starting location. (Because the tip of each <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#0BL86N#2" rel="nofollow noopener">spiroflower</a>
 petal (person)‚Ä¶ is a loop, not a point). Lets say one direction is
GIVING, and the other direction is BILLING/INVOICING. First, lets look
at the goes-around-comes-around of billing. The more wages capitalists
(caps) ask for, the more the caps make their own cost of living go up,
which causes a need to ask for raises, which‚Ä¶ etc etc. All issued
billings/demandings, spiro around and around until it returns to the
issuer. Some call this a ‚Äúself-feeding machine‚Äù and they always blow up.</p>
<p>The very same goes-around-comes-around spirography thing happens to
all ‚Äúissued‚Äù giving/sharing/love. It‚Äôs handed-on, loop, loop, loop, till
 it returns to its issuer. No matter which way (giving or demanding) you
 start rotating the gears and the spirograph pen, the pen ALWAYS,
eventually, returns to its starting place. Spirography‚Ä¶ what goes
around, comes around. So, as long as ‚Äúwe‚Äù condone and allow price tags,
time-carding, and billing, we will continue to have a cost of living to
‚Äúfend off‚Äù. Outlaw price tags (blockades to survival supplies) and
poverty somehow evaporates‚Ä¶ completely. Strange how that works, huh?</p>
<p>To illustrate <a href="https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1BTGPV#14" rel="nofollow noopener">spirography</a>
 in another way, picture a round dinner table with 8 or so people with
plates of food in front of them.  There are three spirographic actions
that can take place.  One‚Ä¶ is ‚Äòidle spirography‚Äô where nobody reaches
across the table to another‚Äôs plate whatsoever.  Lets leave that
condition alone.  Another thing that can happen, is someone reaches
across the table at some angle, and TAKES (bills/demands) some food from
 another‚Äôs plate.  That ‚Äòrobbed‚Äô person is now in fear of not enough
food, and likely will reach across at another angle and take some from
another‚Äôs plate.  The newly robbed person takes some from another‚Äôs
plate.  Each person begins looping the billing around the table, and the
 billing, just like the spirograph pen, eventually returns to the issuer
 of the first billing.  Again, the billing is handed on and on because
each person (spiroflower petal tip) is a LOOP, and not a point.  I call
this ebb spirography‚Ä¶  the handing-on of billings/demandings.</p>
<p>Now, in the opposite spiroflow‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say someone starts off reaching
 across the dinner table to put some of their food onto another‚Äôs plate.
  The receiver of this giving gets NO fear, and there is a pretty good
chance that the receiver of the food gift will see that they now have
too much food, and reach across the table and place food onto another‚Äôs
plate.  And just like the spirograph pen, it eventually returns back to
its initial issuer.  I think you get the theory and point of this.  I
call this flow spirography‚Ä¶ the handing-on of giving/love.</p>
<p>The dreaded debate between human nature and learned behavior gets
involved here.  For these spirograph theories‚Ä¶  one probably needs to
ask oneself if humans are more likely to share things (commune-ity), or
more likely to hoard things (ownership).  And I think abundance is
involved, and so is perceived shortages.  I‚Äôve done some tests on local
wildlife here in the UP of Michigan, and as best I can tell, when there
is plenty of food, the animals share.  When the plate goes empty, the
fears increase, and the animals compete.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sorry, TMI‚Ä¶ but what the hell, I don‚Äôt mind taking a moment to do a critical-thinking deep-dive, between BJS renderingFrames.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>No Willie Gates post in TWC yet, huh?  This might be a LONG wait‚Ä¶ for
 Microsoft to prove that they care about community.  If they do, Windows
 OS will become ‚Äúpay if you can‚Äù immediately, and Willie Gates will help
 me, you, our community, and the other 78 anti-capitalism-ists on the
planet‚Ä¶ stomp that thing back to ‚Äúlevel‚Äù.</p>
<p>C‚Äômon Willie‚Ä¶ join us in doing what‚Äôs right.  There are things that
can be built-into Windows‚Ä¶ to promote money-less communes, and your
machine needs to fully power WikiPedia forever.  Might as well
buy/manage the U.S. postal system, make them the managers of IP domains
(anyone can have a hundred of them for free).  WikiPedia should be
merged with the public libraries, and we need to get all books in
digital form‚Ä¶ so start designing library data-gathering robots.</p>
<p>Oh, let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll need the new TV network‚Ä¶ World Needs TV‚Ä¶ always
begging for volunteers to help with Team World‚Äôs largest problems.  Um‚Ä¶
we‚Äôll be vine-ripening in the orchards and groves, so no cropping, no
picking, no shaking‚Ä¶ and we must wait for the food to ‚Äúfall‚Äù like the
season‚Äôs name tells us.  Max nutrition comes when vine-ripened and not
trucked.  Not trucked, so the people must come to the food, and less
food trucked to the people.  We need fast rail (free, of course).</p>
<p>Same with meat‚Ä¶ no eating animals until they have died of old age or other unexpected reasons.</p>
<p>No barring wildlife from fallen foods.  Share the food with the deer and squirrels and bugs.</p>
<p>All advertisers and money wranglers will have nothing to do in our
new Team Earth‚Ä¶ so I hope they don‚Äôt mind putting-in a little fall-net
work in our new WIDESPREAD groves and orchards.  It‚Äôs much more
enjoyable work than your old jobs of peddling crap-products and lies.</p>
<p>All worksites are all-volunteer, and will essentially be carnivals
and festivals.  The objective is to make people ‚Äúget-to‚Äù go to work,
instead-of ‚Äúhave-to‚Äù go to work.  Worksites will be VERY fun with no set
 hours and not a single ‚Äúdead-line‚Äù, no demented terms/phenomena such as
 ‚Äúfired‚Äù or ‚Äúterminated‚Äù, or any other OR-ELSing.  Never put/leave
anyone over a barrel, behind an 8-ball, or sucking hind tit.  (heh)</p>
<p>World Needs TV will ASK for help‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôll be concentrating only on
necessities in the beginning, not luxuries.  All current luxuries will
be put into the Team Earth Enjoyments Repository to be shared equally by
 all, and cared-for by all.  Intentionally mistreat a Team Earth
resource, and you go to jail.</p>
<p>But jail is not like ANY jail you have EVER seen.  It‚Äôs more like
‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs not damage Team Earth resources‚Äù reminder school.  There
won‚Äôt be any robbery‚Ä¶ nothing is owned, and you can requisition ANYTHING
 from Team Earth supplies division, by showing just the SLIGHTEST of
justification in your requisition form.</p>
<p>And after we assemble this HIGHLY-loving, very fair,
well-within-Christian-guidelines, logic-based resources-based system‚Ä¶ we
 will be VERY VERY proud of it. If Earth IS a space craft‚Ä¶ step <span class="hashtag">#1</span>‚Ä¶ crew must get-along with each other.  This is why StarFleet‚Ä¶ abolished money/ownership.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/wink_003.png" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>We all know what must be done.  Willie Gates CAN help us make it
happen, but he must sacrifice his monetary empire‚Ä¶ yet use his OTHER
empowerments (Microsoft reputation and products)‚Ä¶ to help us get this
‚Äúgood and right‚Äù thing‚Ä¶ done.</p>
<p>Does he REALLY care about commune-ity?  We‚Äôll wait here and see.  We
have called-out to him.  His team members are nearby.  Will any of them
risk their paychecks‚Ä¶ to show Willie our extremely-large community
concern?  Microsoft software products are very widespread.  It is a
MASSIVELY-powerful microphone, and a way to wire-together the
‚Äúhave-a-say‚Äù system, the ‚ÄúEveryone is a member of Team Earth government‚Äù
 feature.  Does he care about community ENOUGH‚Ä¶ to help us out?</p>
<p>hmm.  C‚Äômon ‚ÄúWorkspace Willie‚Äù !  Let‚Äôs GO!  Lots of children are
getting crushed on the bottom layer of the capitalism pyramid scheme.
Let‚Äôs level it.  Upper layers are ‚Äúheads in the clouds‚Äù and can‚Äôt see
the lower layers.  World Health Org numbers for preventable
child-under-5 deaths‚Ä¶ ATROCIOUS!  PLEASE help us, if you can!  (thx)</p>

        <p>not sure another opinion is really needed, but will add one anyway!  i am one of the ‚Äúfree‚Äù helpers, too:)<br>
I really enjoy spending my time in the forums and working on the project
 without really being concerned if anybody is employed to do so, because
 it‚Äôs absolutely amazing the good things BJS can bring to the world.
I‚Äôm not talking about video games, but educational tools, apps without
permissions (PWA), XR to the masses, etc. i‚Äôve known for a good while
that the BabylonJS team was growing with Microsoft team members, but I
still see that as a good thing.  Lots of great projects are sponsored.
Microsoft has opened up so much in the last few years embracing open
source.  Obviously part of that corporate direction is for gltf model
support, but isn‚Äôt it great to have such fantastic support (I think the
best WebGL support that exists) for an open standard format?  I think <em>MOST</em>
 of the changes are driven from requests in the forum instead of a board
 room.  How many times have people asked for something and got a PR
within a few hours?</p>

<p>Hi BZ!</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a desperate situation. I‚Äôll beg ANYONE for help.  Powerful
capitalists have a say in the world, seeing they are worshiped.  They
are the ONLY people with power/say, these days.  The pope (and quite a
pile of other morality leaders, religious and not) already condemned
capitalism. Caps yawned and kept on doing it, full-throttle.  That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a
serious addiction‚Ä¶ when THAT happens.  See-no-evil, hear-no-evil,
speak-no-evil.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with making a good profit‚Äù is
their guiding creed, yet I can show them well over 10,000 things wrong
with making a ‚Äúgood‚Äù profit.  They won‚Äôt hear me.  ‚Äúnuh uh‚Äù festival.</p>
<p>Besides, where do you think the Gates Foundation got that ‚Äúbillions
and billions‚Äù?  Possibly from their harvester?  Possibly they helped
cause the poverty that they now attempt to soothe?  That
community-wellbeing-providing money was sucked/mowed off the planet, and
 put into the Microsoft emBANKment.</p>
<p>Side-learn:  ‚ÄúOrdering‚Äù is an enjoyment that many people‚Ä¶ easily get
addicted-to, ESPECIALLY ordering servants in restaurants‚Ä¶ to cook/fetch
them food‚Ä¶ OR ELSE THEY‚ÄôRE FIRED!  I call it ‚ÄúKing-for-a-day‚Äù‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs
more like ‚Äúking for a moment, many times each day‚Äù.  Being a king,
ordering servants to build you meals, toys, toilet paper, boats, cars,
campers, etc, and ordering labor to paint your house and do your lawns
pretty‚Ä¶ fix your sewers and cars and other dirty things‚Ä¶ is HIGHLY
addictive (remember the empowerments starvation I described in a
previous post).  Ordering‚Ä¶ is widespread within capitalism.  It‚Äôs what
they do.  Even if the pope tells them to stop because it is disgustingly
 immoral and illogical and people/Earth-resources-damaging‚Ä¶ caps can‚Äôt
stop.  It‚Äôs exactly the same as trying to tell a cocaine addict that
cocaine is unhealthy.  It doesn‚Äôt matter, they can‚Äôt stop.  Caps can‚Äôt
stop ordering‚Ä¶ in multiple ways.</p>

Capitalism is <span class="hashtag">#1</span> world problem, and it is 100% the reason for this current, seriously-pending, and yet-unsolved problem in the BJS community.</p>
<p>This problem‚Ä¶ my issue‚Ä¶ is likely to be ‚Äúblown off‚Äù by the local
capitalists‚Ä¶ as they habitually label everything with ‚ÄúEverything is
fine‚Äù labels (rose-colored glasses).  I‚Äôve been watching their
blindering/blow-it-off tactics/maneuvering‚Ä¶ for most of my life.
‚ÄúEverything is fine‚Äù labeling is the way caps blow-off things that they
don‚Äôt want to face-up-to.  Formally called ‚Äúcomplacency‚Äù or ‚Äúforsaking‚Äù‚Ä¶
 (not giving a crap about anything except profit/paychecks)</p>
<p>I‚Äôve done a crap-load of work for BJS.  Will BJS do a little bit of
work‚Ä¶ for Team Earth?  Help with a little louder microphone?  Maybe a
‚Äúhands-off-BJS and its paid team‚Äù letter, at minimum?</p>
<p>We‚Äôll see.  The community has a problem.  Let‚Äôs see if ‚Äúcommunity is
first‚Äù as their paid video-makers claim.  Is the Gates Foundation
willing to do NON-monetary help‚Ä¶ using their OTHER power instead?  We‚Äôll
 soon know if ‚Äúcommunity first‚Äù was crock-of-shit, or true.</p>
<p>We don‚Äôt need to help the poor‚Ä¶ IF the caps would quit ALLOWING
and/or PUSHING people toward falling into poverty (via
continuously-rising cost-of-living).  No lifting is needed when no
falling happened.  That big pile of MS money‚Ä¶ contributed to poverty and
 falling.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want money.  I want Bill/foundation to decide if/not they
think I am correct about all this, and to recognize the giant rift they
caused in our BJS commune, and PUBLICLY own-up to ALL OF IT, if he/they
agree.  Let‚Äôs see if he notices how HIS involvement in BJS‚Ä¶ caused this
community member‚Ä¶ to have no say/power about BJS directions (or world
directions) and cap-involvements.</p>
<p>Will the caps yet again win this battle, because commune-folk have no
 say/power?  Is community the boss of capitalism, or is capitalism the
boss of community?  We‚Äôll soon find out.</p>

<p>Hey, thanks for being a ‚Äúpure‚Äù!  Comments ALWAYS welcomed/needed
(even by paids).  And no hurry.  TWC operates at critical-thinking
speeds, slow ironing-out of wrinkles.  The capitalism time-card-marching
 system‚Ä¶ is completely irrelevant here in TWC.  The LAST thing we want
to allow the free marketeers to attempt here‚Ä¶ is a hurried ‚Äúplease
move-on‚Äù.  Nope, this capitalism pressure cooker won‚Äôt be blown-off or
labeled as ‚Äúeverything is fine‚Äù‚Ä¶ until it is properly addressed and
answered-up-for.  They‚Äôll probably get violent‚Ä¶ start attempting some
‚Äúordering‚Äù.</p>
<p>It would be sweet if a Redmond-area newspaper‚Ä¶ republished the pertinent TWC posts‚Ä¶ starting at <a href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/the-wingnut-chronicles/97/124">first presentation</a>.
  If the Gates Foundation and MS won‚Äôt take a stance on capitalism HERE,
 then maybe they will own-up to the truth about capitalism‚Ä¶ to THEIR
local community.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve only seen Windows Willie a few times on TV and videos, but, he
seems like a sweetheart (just like Deltakosh).  I think he‚Äôs one of us.
 But he has an internal conflict to deal-with‚Ä¶ before he can/will climb
aboard our commune cause.  He has to own-up that the claims that I have
made here in TWC‚Ä¶ are reasonably accurate, or even that he understands
this situation.  Will his heart win?  Or will his company win?  It‚Äôs
going to be a sweet time of reckoning.  I think he‚Äôll land in Hippy
Do-Gooderville‚Ä¶ where I will personally hug him until snot squirts out
of his schnoz!  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_003.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>All he has to do‚Ä¶ is point to this thread‚Ä¶ and publicly say
‚ÄúThere‚Ä¶are the answers to the world‚Äôs largest problems‚Äù.  Suddenly‚Ä¶
we‚Äôre on our way to a better world, with a MUCH louder microphone.  A
Microsoft Microphone!</p>
<p>Perhaps add-in the new Windows ‚Äúhave a say‚Äù system‚Ä¶ no-login,
no-join, no-censoring, no-charge super-chat/super-voting.  Then we have a
 ROCKET-propelled Microsoft Microphone (with its loud-speaker aimed
towards the abolishing of economies/competing, of course).  Allow CSS
chat-styles and ‚Äúrooms‚Äù and send html OBJECT elements to other chatters,
 so you have a multimedia storytelling system, too.  This multimedia
chat/storytelling‚Ä¶ should be more popular than evening TV-watching‚Ä¶ by‚Ä¶
2025‚Ä¶ if done right/free.  No ads, and no streaming across it.
Long-distance streaming is a luxury and thus it loads-down the internet
and life.  Send the HTML OBJECT element (with src url), that asks/orders
 the remote browser‚Ä¶ to get the media from the web.  Never send the
media itself‚Ä¶ across the HavAsay system.  Allow full/partial gagging of
any user‚Ä¶ by receiver (to prevent ad/porn-sprayers from spamming a
chat/voting room/group).  FUN!  Noble/No-Bull.</p>
<p>Thanks for the comments.  Keep 'em coming.</p>

<p>Are you pro-capitalism, then?  I can‚Äôt determine.</p>
<p>Formal establishment can happen without letting disgusting capitalism‚Ä¶ contaminate the project.</p>
<p>Also, ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù == leaving behind child-like tug-o-warring games,
and leaving behind ‚ÄúLook at us, ain‚Äôt we something‚Äù PR-crap.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMom, mom, look what I did, look at ME go!  Ain‚Äôt I wonderful?  You sure must love ME!‚Äù.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs time to leave behind the affirmation addiction gotten from mom
sticking our art onto the fridge‚Ä¶ with decorative refrigerator magnets.
 Yes, let‚Äôs all grow up‚Ä¶ and stop the tug-o-wars right here and now.
Time for the deluded children to stop hugging the appalling teddy bear‚Ä¶
called capitalism.</p>
<p>Time to stop buying dragon-fire thermal protection blankets‚Ä¶ from the
 dragon. (protective emBANKing and catastrophic-bill insurance).  The
dragon causes the ‚Äúcost-of-living‚Äù, and caps THANK IT for selling them
protection from the fire.  They don‚Äôt realize that they are feeding the
dragon, making it more powerful, which causes the need for them to buy
thicker thermal blankets‚Ä¶ DAILY!</p>
<p>Branding?  It‚Äôs just as painful to living things as it ALWAYS was.
It burns like hell, and it is to be avoided at all costs.  Stay free,
stay natural, don‚Äôt sign aboard ANYTHING that isn‚Äôt loving.
Capitalism/competer‚Äôs church is FAR FAR FAR from loving.</p>
<p>Always remember, if the deer and bugs and birds and squirrels don‚Äôt do it, humans shouldn‚Äôt either.  Not natural.</p>

        <p>Hi again.  Whelp, as best i can tell, if MS doesn‚Äôt turn
‚Äúcommunity minded‚Äù instead of capitalist‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt help-with or promote
BJS anymore.  I apologize to those who I promoted BJS-to, as it seems I
have unintentionally lead you all astray.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been working on a BJS song‚Ä¶ a drivin‚Äô boogie-woogie‚Ä¶ very similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1I0jXUM8wo" rel="nofollow noopener">this version of Sea Cruise</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been scraping together funds to try to afford a little studio
time to produce it‚Ä¶ but I never got there before the air got sucked out
of my sails.</p>
<p>Seeing that none of you stood by my side as I raised this issue, and
that ya‚Äôll are headed right down the PR center-line of capitalism
boulevard‚Ä¶ ya might just as well have the lyrics before I split.</p>
<p>Hard-driving boogie-woogie songs do more for advertising/promotion (peddling) than any ‚Äútrust us‚Ä¶ we care‚Ä¶ REALLY‚Äù video can.</p>

<p>(It‚Äôs a) Babylon Saturday Night<br>
By Wingnut &amp; The AntiCaps<br>
21 Mar 2019</p>
<p>v1:<br>
Well it‚Äôs the weekend time, and I‚Äôm won-der-in‚Äô what I‚Äôm gonna do.<br>
I got my PC hummin‚Äô, and the monitor is callin‚Äô yoo hoo.<br>
You know I start‚Ä¶ real‚Ä¶ simple‚Ä¶ with a box and a sphere,<br>
cuz I know imagination gonna take it from here,<br>
Turn-on a camera and light‚Ä¶<br>
It‚Äôs a Babylon Saturday Night.</p>
<p>v2:<br>
You know that Delta and the gang‚Ä¶ they‚Äôve been cuttin‚Äô-up the web G-L.<br>
A couple bangs‚Ä¶ on the keys‚Ä¶ and I build a world‚Ä¶ easy-as-hell.<br>
I got my vectors on a worldspace line,<br>
I got materials and colors fine,<br>
Yeah every thing feels right‚Ä¶<br>
It‚Äôs a Babylon Saturday Night</p>
<p>bridge:<br>
Babylon JS‚Ä¶ grab a file and play-us‚Ä¶ sure to chase the blues away.<br>
Babylon JS‚Ä¶ nothin‚Äô gonna sway-us‚Ä¶ Babylon is here to stay‚Ä¶<br>
so I say‚Ä¶</p>
<p>v3:<br>
I‚Äôm gonna code the friggin‚Äô night away‚Ä¶ a-dreamin-up my game or app.<br>
It might be loved, or maybe not, or will they laugh‚Ä¶ like I could give a crap.<br>
The opportunities are far and wide,<br>
I‚Äôm gonna get on this horse and ride,<br>
No interruptions in sight‚Ä¶<br>
It‚Äôs a Babylon Saturday Night.</p>
<p>Well I‚Äôm a-feelin‚Äô alright‚Ä¶ cuz it‚Äôs a<br>
Babylon Saturday Night.</p>
<hr>
<p>I‚Äôm far-from a pro song-writer‚Ä¶ sorry.  I officially place this song
(these lyrics) in the public domain, free to use for your
peddling/commercial gains.  Have fun.</p>

<p>The community is the main reason I‚Äôve stuck with Babylon.js for as
long as I have (about 1.5 months) and I‚Äôve tried three.js, but the main
problem was that there was no set forums.  Like what bjs had before
these, posts were on stackoverflow, but unlike bjs three.js was not on
html5gamedevs.</p>
<p>I hope you rethink your decision to leave.  A lot of people will miss you.</p>

        <p>It can all be fixed very simply, with the methods I have already given.</p>
<p>C‚Äômon, you guys.  Microsoft is ALREADY 3/4 way to commune NOW!  One
of the biggest corporations, with one of the best reputations, with
probably THE most powerful people-helping foundation attached, and what
might be the NICEST founder/owner that we have seen in DECADES!</p>
<p>Get the URL to the rant/problem‚Ä¶ to Bill Gates.  Should we remove the
 extraneous posts from the rant?  Should I put it in a more-presentable
package?  Doctor it up with tact like a cap would do?</p>
<p>I want to be heard‚Ä¶ by deltakosh‚Äôs supreme boss‚Ä¶ which is BJS‚Äôs supreme leader too, now.</p>
<p>If MS claims to care about community, then my message will get to
Bill Gates.  Deltakosh should be hand-carrying my my my concerns‚Ä¶ on a
silver platter, to wherever Mr. Gates basks in his empowerments.  We
REALLY need him and his power‚Ä¶ to help us kill a terrorist‚Ä¶ a terrorist
called cost-of-living.</p>
<p>Kill the fire-starter dragon, don‚Äôt keep fighting fires.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a member of this community‚Ä¶ at least for a little while longer.  I
 want a say.  Can I have one‚Ä¶ with the supreme controller, Bill Gates?
Will good friends help carry my message to him?  I think they might be
too scared of him.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm still learning‚Ä¶ still testing the integrity and intestinal fortitude of my friends, here.</p>

        <p>Like others I would be sad to see you leave. I am not with
you on much that you have said and how you said it so I suppose that
makes me unpure even if unpaid. What I mainly disagree with you is your
melding of this forum and the BJS core team with your satan, capitalism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was active duty U.S. Air Force from 1976-1985). I loved it. It was a
 commune‚Ä¶ and we all took care of one another‚Ä¶ central team‚Ä¶ altruists‚Ä¶
watching -out for the other guy first, and then checking on self‚Ä¶ later</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When you were on active duty for the U.S. AirForce you were able to
separate you and your commune within it from the very powerful
capitalist enforcer you were working for. When you were there who knows
what orders you could have been given, it could have turned out very
badly for you are your commune. In the same way the BJS community and
this forum can be a commune whatever the outer controlling powers are
and whatever that may or may not imply for the future. Just like your
AirForce life, nothing lasts forever.</p>
<p>So just a final plea for you to re-engage with this forum as the
nurturer you are. Saving the planet can be done by giving an example to
others on how to care for those using this forum as you always have.</p>

        <p>Test 1 - 2 - 3‚Ä¶ are we on the air?  Huh?  Check, check.</p>
<p>Wow, sorry about that 24-hour interruption in TWC.</p>
<p>I got pulled-over. I got a ticket for ‚ÄúRail-roading/Ram-rodding on a
family-style band-wagoning trail‚Äù.  Kind of a long detainment, but they
were really nice‚Ä¶ gave me cookies and Hi-C.</p>
<p>They kept staring at my butt, and then I went to hospital.
Apparently I had a bur in my saddle, and I also had some gravel
packed-into my ass-crack.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/astonished.png" title=":astonished:" class="emoji" alt=":astonished:"></p>
<p>Anyway, the doctors fixed me up, and then they let me go again‚Ä¶ after
 I promised to keep my freight locomotive off-of the town‚Äôs sidewalks.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Oh well‚Ä¶ I got my/the statement made.  I‚Äôll try to think-up some stupid 3D jokes to lighten the mood, soon.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, it‚Äôs been an ordeal.  Sometimes that happens‚Ä¶ often
it‚Äôs necessary.  I still have a personal problem to deal-with.  I‚Äôm not
sure HOW to roll THAT booger, yet.</p>

<p>They can get some forum questions answered‚Ä¶ now that they‚Äôre all coffee‚Äôd up.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

 a little gold star, for tackling a 14-hour followCam question.
Obviously, John has no Sunday life/purpose.)  hehe.  (Just kidding, of
course.)</p>

<p>i feel i am new in here</p>

</aside>
<p>Hi Naz!</p>
<p>Deltakosh gave me permission to reply-to (actually, he simply didn‚Äôt specifically prohibit it, yet) ‚Ä¶questions about <a href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/the-wingnut-chronicles/97/124">the anticap rally in TWC park</a>.  So‚Ä¶ here I go.  (Wingy dons a combat helmet and flak jacket.)</p>
<p>I feel that way too, Naz (new in here)‚Ä¶ but I must be careful what I
say here in TWC, now.  In short, they tried to drag BJS into a
capitalism mud hole, and I got spanked for trying to have a
say/free-opinion about that.  I guess I was too mean/brutal.  Or‚Ä¶ bad
topic for the topic police that I thought had given me a permit to speak
 freely.</p>
<p>I learned some things, and am STILL learning.  I learned that there
are a substantial amount of ‚Äúfragiles‚Äù around here‚Ä¶ who get offended
over nearly anything‚Ä¶ and they got ESPECIALLY offended/fragile when I
blew the lid off-of something they are thoroughly addicted-to and
hugging with all their might (a false deity).</p>
<p>It IS still ‚Äúopen‚Äù, but the steering committee is all-capitalist,
now.  Paychecks are having an effect/affect upon BJS‚Ä¶ maybe/likely
‚Äúcalling‚Äù some ‚Äúshots‚Äù (directing decisions).  The investigation is
still underway, but within the underground, now.  No longer public,
after the censoring.  Too dangerous.</p>
<p>For being an international project‚Ä¶ they sure aren‚Äôt very tolerant of
 non-capitalism-addicted nations‚Ä¶ such as Venezuela and other Bolivarian
 views.  Bolivarians/anti-caps are in trouble‚Ä¶ if they visit here.  BJS
community is a microcosm of what USA capitalism is doing to Venezuela
RIGHT NOW‚Ä¶ threatening it.  (microcosm = miniature version/clone)</p>
<p>We also might be seeing a ‚Äúsanctioning‚Äù microcosm, a reflection of
the USA Trumpian terrorism (sanctioning) that is being imposed-upon
non-conforming-to-imposed-rules nations‚Ä¶ around the world.  Naz‚Ä¶ YOUR
country is under a TON of capitalism-imposed-rule attempts and
sanctioning, eh?  Sorry, bud.  Capitalists are pretty disgusting.  I‚Äôm
working-on fixing it, but it is likely I will get ‚Äúsilenced‚Äù, soon.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll let the paids further explain what they did, if they can realize
 what it is, yet.  Safer for me.  I don‚Äôt like being bombed for talking‚Ä¶
 AT ALL.  Scary.</p>
<p>Local authorities MAY have gotten 2-years-addicted to ordering-around
 worker-bees, and they recently treated me as an order-able, and are
likely treating BJS as an order-able, too.</p>
<p>I might be in trouble AGAIN, just for saying what I did here‚Ä¶ in this reply.  I gotta shut up, now.</p>
<p>Current state:  There is a disagreement on whether/not an anti-cap
rant was ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù here and now.  Local authorities say ‚Äúno,
capitalism has no affect on BJS steering, so relax‚Äù.  My group says
‚Äúyes, it‚Äôs time for you to own-up to capitalism‚Äôs disgusting-ness, so
you don‚Äôt allow any of its gross germs‚Ä¶ to attach to BJS‚Äù.</p>
<p>(Wingy dives back into his foxhole like a little girlie-man, and quickly changes back into his clown uniform)</p>
<p>I lost my ‚Äúreset bump date‚Äù choice/menu‚Ä¶ to avoid edited posts from being bumped to top.  I wonder if I got demoted.</p>

<p>You might be physically weak (me too + sick, sad, broke, and
toothless), but you are NOT weak intellectually or heart-wise.  You are
VERY strong in those ways.  I‚Äôm proud and honored to know you.</p>
<p>I wish I could know you better/closer.</p>
<p>OOOH, I just got a ‚Äúnice reply‚Äù award by the forum‚Ä¶ for getting 10+
LIKES on a post!  YAY!  Unfortunately, it was given for talking about
frivolity such as Babylon 5, and not for the much higher-priority and
higher-importance topics in THIS thread.</p>

any risk and danger about solutions if i disagree with that solution i
most write  the reason the only like or love the post is not useful</p>
<ul>
<li>notice we have solution checked too<br>
i think  talk about future of bjs is so important and useful for user</li>
</ul>
<p>my works not so familiar with babylonjs ways i actually try wired ways always that can not used a bit too but <strong>i like share</strong>
 what i  think i like try new ways and help all new or old members ( if i
 can ) i cant help a special group or team they separated them self with
 other member maybe i am close to jedi with dark force <img src="twc8_e2_files/smiley_002.png" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
when i see a question in open framework don‚Äôt think who write that</p>
<p>for my imaging babylonjs is snake the leaders is head of that snake and members is body what happen if we cut the head</p>
<ul>
<li>i don‚Äôt like be in head without body</li>
<li>i don‚Äôt like be in body without of head</li>
</ul>

        <p>Hey, we were recently talking about ‚Äúgotta‚Äù vs. ‚Äúget to‚Äù.  Interesting!</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt you wish school was SO MUCH FUN, that you would ‚Äúget to‚Äù go‚Ä¶ and be hurried because you had SO MUCH FUN ahead?</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt like ‚Äúgotta‚Äù (force).  I like ‚Äúget-to‚Äù (free choice).</p>
<p>I think‚Ä¶ 3JS is being steered by Google.  (Deltakosh told me that its
 author is Google employee, and he, too, is being paid by Google to dev
3JS.)</p>
<p>I did a little sniffing around.  There‚Äôs a few webGL libs that are still free-of-corporate‚Ä¶ but not many.</p>

<p>I kinda like school.  On of my classes is like a free period but it‚Äôs
 not and our school calls it the ‚ÄúTech Nest‚Äù (We are the Winhawks)  Last
 fall we went to TIES 2018 (that was fun) and presented on how we
livestream. (I was manning a camera) So we live streamed our
presentation for people not there (like for the district if anyone
wanted to watch) and had the actual livestream being projected while we
were presenting.  (so the people in the audience could see what the
people at home were seeing)   We had like 10-15 or so people in the
audience (the room was on the smaller side.)  That class is my favorite
but my other ones aren‚Äôt all bad.</p>
<p>Most of the time I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúhey I get to go to fifth hour (the Tech
Nest ‚Äúclass‚Äù)‚Äù  as it requires meeting with the principal to get his
signature, and having good grades.  plus we are like the I.T. before the
 I.T. when we help people.</p>

<p>Originally, I wanted some debate and feedback about these anti-cap claims, but <em>some</em>
 are SO upset over the subject matter‚Ä¶ that they went off-topic and
started quoting posting rules and regulations‚Ä¶ rules and regulations
that I never signed MY name-to.  (Remember the empowerment starvation
problem that I mentioned earlier?  Self-appointed ‚Äújunior

trying to wield their limp-as-a-noodle scepters of power - pathetic.)</p>

<p>How pathetic and deluded.  Here in activists land, we consider being
booted from a blog‚Ä¶ as a 100% ‚Äúimpact success‚Äù, so wussy threats of
‚Äúdenial of service‚Äù don‚Äôt slow us power-activists‚Ä¶ what-so-ever.  (I say
 this, just in case these ‚Äúregulations-quoters‚Äù think they have ANY say‚Ä¶
 about activism for good‚Äôn‚Äôright things)</p>
<p>There, that‚Äôs said and done, now.  Sometimes we need to awaken the
cop-wannabes, so they can get a fresh grasp on reality.  Party-on!</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll ping-assign this issue to <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/deltakosh">@Deltakosh</a>,
 who will likely ping TrevorDev, who may ping someone ‚Äúbeneath‚Äù him, who
 might ping another, who‚Ä¶ hehe. Poop-rolls-down-hill ping-strings. <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">‚Äù</p>
<p>About that:</p>
<p>This is a goofy system that slows responses and fools users, which I
don‚Äôt understand.  Ranking/delegating is apparently here to stay (I
would have cancelled that system in a second, but I got no say in that,
sorry).  I am trying to keep this issue in ONE thread, but nobody is
addressing these issues.</p>
<p>Users must be patient‚Ä¶ as the pinging-pass-along traverses to the
bottom rung and becomes a do-it-or-else work-order to some poor,
low-ranking schmuck.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/open_mouth_002.png" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:">
  THE MOST depressing thing about this system?  User gets a notification
 that an answer to his/her question has happened.  User rushes to forum
with hope and excitement‚Ä¶ only to find the disappointment of a
pass-along delegating ping.  SAD!!!  TERRIBLE!!!  BJS popularity-killing
 - 101.</p>
<p>Find a different delegating system, eh?  And it would be nice and
transparent‚Ä¶ if answers by ‚Äúdelegated helpers‚Äù‚Ä¶ are marked as such.
That way the user can know if the answer was given by someone under
orders, or by a pure helper.</p>
<p>Are you paying attention, DK?  I WILL hand-hold you until you
understand, as needed.  You‚Äôre well-worth the effort of awakening, even
if I‚Äôm taking fire, doing it.  (You have kindly held my-my-my hand
plenty of times, on the technical-side.)  Is this the kind of system‚Ä¶
that you wanted/hoped-for?  YECH!</p>
<p>Sorry guys, I gotta keep fighting for good‚Äôn‚Äôright‚Ä¶ because a
disgusting thing has attacked BJS and I want it gone.  Or‚Ä¶ at least get a
 disinfectant shield against its creeping bacteria (a letter of promise
from Mr. Gates or HIS boss).  If I get permanently banned (or killed)
for fighting-for good‚Äôn‚Äôright, then so be it.</p>

        <p>Sometimes ping-passing can be a good thing.  When somebody
sees my topic, and they ping another person, it can be helpful.  If my
topic is deep in the recent, and somebody pings in it, it brings it up
and helps the person who can help be notified.  It helps somebody know
that they should be able to help.  I‚Äôve never had a more than one
ping-pass on a topic, but single pings help.</p>

<p>Do any TWC readers know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework" rel="nofollow noopener">RDF</a> (resource description framework) (a type of XML schema/markup/dtd)?</p>
<p>It is/can-be involved-in a thing called ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology" rel="nofollow noopener">ontology</a>‚Äù.</p>
<p>Loosely defined, it is the study of ‚Äúcategorization characteristics‚Äù.
  If we were to build a Glossary of Terms (GT) that relate to
BJS/3D/Everything-Else-We-Deal-With, we will want to categorize those
terms‚Ä¶ sort-able by ‚Äúcharacteristics‚Äù.  This is the way to begin‚Ä¶ an
auto-pinging system for Discourse-brand blogs.</p>
<p>Some single-word terms‚Ä¶ will meet MULTIPLE ‚Äúcharacteristics criteria‚Äù
 (CC) (somewhat rare).  A single sentence‚Ä¶ is VERY likely to meet
multiple cc‚Äôs.</p>
<p>Example question title:  ‚ÄúNeed help setting Math.sin rotation on ribbon impostor‚Äù</p>
<p>There, we have a math question, mixed with a transformation question,
 mixed with a parametric shapes question, mixed with a physics question.
  Four terms that COULD trigger 4 different categorization criteria‚Ä¶ and
 thus 4 helper departments get auto-pinged from the question‚Äôs TITLE
ALONE.</p>
<p>Weird, eh?  Ontologies.  The question TITLE carried four different
ontological ‚Äúthingies‚Äù  (cc‚Äôs).  (‚Äúcharacteristics criteria‚Äù or
‚Äúcategorization criteria‚Äù or ‚Äúcategorization characteristics‚Äù)</p>
<p>If we build our ‚Äúglossary structure‚Äù in a multi-usage way, it can
also be used for ‚Äúauto-help‚Äù, and can become integrated with our help
pages.  Use same possibly-RDF glossary-file structure, but now two or
more systems can use/read that GT‚Ä¶ for potentially-automated good-stuff.
  Sort of a DTD/schema for BJS terminology.</p>
<p>Anyone on my frequency?  On other recent TWC topics, it seems I have
been transmitting on frequencies that few can tune their radios-to.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/open_mouth_002.png" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"></p>

        <p>Thx S!  You certainly could be correct on that.  And perhaps
Taxonomy is a better term.  I ALREADY need a terminology assistant.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/smiley_002.png" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence" rel="nofollow noopener">existence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality" rel="nofollow noopener">reality</a>, as well as the basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_being" rel="nofollow noopener">categories of being</a> and their relations.‚Äù  (‚Äúbeing‚Äù not necessarily == living thing, here.  A screwdriver has ‚Äúbeing‚Äù, too).</p>
<p>‚Äúhow such entities may be grouped, related within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy" rel="nofollow noopener">hierarchy</a>, and subdivided according to similarities and differences.‚Äù</p>
<p>Both of those lines were in the link I provided.  I‚Äôm easy, though‚Ä¶
define as ye wish.  We‚Äôre just looking for basic understanding, here,
because that‚Äôs all I have to offer.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Readers‚Ä¶ be sure to check-out <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/syntheticmagus">@syntheticmagus</a> link, because it is likely more apropos than the link I offered-up.  Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Also, newer/wiser tech might be available to do this‚Ä¶ more easily and powerfully.  I‚Äôm with <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/jerome">@jerome</a>
 on this.  I was reasonably well-read about RDF‚Ä¶ about 10 years ago.  I
think‚Ä¶ maybe XSL and XPath can be used to transform the BIG FAT GT‚Ä¶ into
 a tiny return-to-user-after-term-search‚Ä¶ document.  It doesn‚Äôt modify
the source doc‚Ä¶ just DISPLAYS the source doc‚Ä¶ AS-IF it were a new, much
smaller xml-doc/webpage.  WHICH content it decides to display/return‚Ä¶ is
 based-upon XSL transformation instructions‚Ä¶ within the
XSL/XPath/XQuery/stylesheet.</p>
<p>It is somewhat CSS related - a ‚Äústylesheet‚Äù, transforming an XML document into‚Ä¶ something different.  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/WhatIsXSL.html" rel="nofollow noopener">XSL</a> stands for eXtensible Stylesheet Language.</p>

  beliefs vs. provable knowledge, and the study of what makes something
provable.  Hard evidence, soft evidence, flexibility and hard-lining.

My wife is a full-blown hippy, but also misses the lower age limit of
those who are traditionally associated with the hippy generation by a
few years.</p>
<p>Currently, I‚Äôm working on a textbook on learning Babylon.JS and
developing an online course that will hopefully see the light of day
this summer.<br>
I‚Äôve written a few other textbooks on Corona SDK and Unity.  All indie published.<br>
Really excited about Babylon.JS and being able to deliver 3D &amp; VR via browser.</p>
<p>My primary focus is using technology to create alternative learning
solutions for children such as home-schooled, health-issues,
international travelers, or others who want a quality education that may
 not be available in their geographic area.<br>
A summer goal is to create a proto-type education environment using Babylon.JS (let the coding/modeling/networking begin!).</p>

        <p>Dr. Burton, meet Rahman Nasimi asl (<a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/nasimiasl">@nasimiasl</a>) (or ‚ÄúNaz‚Äù as i call him).</p>
<p>He is lead programmer at Microsoft in Tehran‚Ä¶ and a coding God, shader God, and general nice guy.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs that, Naz?  Oh, you went independent cuz Microsoft wasn‚Äôt letting you smoke pot on the job?</p>
<p>What‚Äôs that?   Not THAT reason?  ohhhh.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Naz is a long-time local hero‚Ä¶ and codes/builds some of the ODDEST,
yet most-powerful BJS tools and scenes‚Ä¶ we have EVER seen.  We think
maybe he is AT LEAST half-alien or half Cray computer.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Dr. Burton‚Ä¶ if you don‚Äôt know it by now, a super nice/smart guy named <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/deltakosh">@Deltakosh</a> is the lead programmer/designer of BJS.  He‚Äôs always around somewhere, helping someone do something, and he LOVES ‚Äúpuppies‚Äù.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>There‚Äôs a Naz playground using his ShaderBuilder tool‚Ä¶ which is a sister to his GeometryBuilder tool.</p>
<p>See that code?  It‚Äôs like trying to read Swahili.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>A long time ago‚Ä¶ I packed-together an older g-builder and old s-builder‚Ä¶ and he taught me how to do a ‚Äúfirst step‚Äù of BOTH.  <a href="https://playground.babylonjs.com//#179VAS#1" rel="nofollow noopener">https://playground.babylonjs.com//#179VAS#1</a></p>
<p>Just a LITTLE Swahili in that one.  Hey <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/nasimiasl">@nasimiasl</a>, show us one of your big fat monsters.</p>
<p>Ya gotta BE a Cray computer‚Ä¶ just to READ the code (in one of his FAT

Tuesday‚Ä¶ for an hour or two‚Ä¶ Team Redmond (or wherever they park
themselves)‚Ä¶ works-on the BJS GT.</p>
<p>Might as well get some DECENT use from the MS money dribbling-down those feeding nipples, eh?</p>
<p>Oooh, that‚Äôs nasty talk, huh? The Paids HATE when I do that, but we
need to point-out the MYRIAD of troubles that they have caused for the
BJS community.  It only gets uglier from here, gang.</p>
<p>Yep, if the paid helpers give a crap about doing things right and
getting organized, they‚Äôll handle this.  The idea is laying on the
ground in front of them, now.  We‚Äôll see if any of them pick it up, blow
 the dirt-off, and run with it.</p>
<p>Only one line of enthusiasm seen from The Paids so far‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I liek the idea of having a ‚Äúping user‚Äù that will not be a regular answer so no one but the ‚Äúpingee‚Äù will be pinged</p>

<p>The idea might be a ‚Äúfailure to launch‚Äù, John, and YOU already have a
 TON of workload on YOUR plate‚Ä¶ being Chief Docs Custodian.  It‚Äôs nearly
 fishing season for me, and I‚Äôm building another band, so I won‚Äôt be
contributing much time to it, other than the spiriting/spearheading that
 I have done in recent posts.</p>
<p>I think semi-automating the helper systems is a worthwhile endeavor.
 The steering committee may disagree, and they have the final say.  It
is really FOR them, anyway (and the users).</p>
<p>How many working class folk‚Ä¶ voluntarily go to their job‚Ä¶ during
‚Äúoff-hours‚Äù?  FEW!  Each paid member‚Ä¶ generally-speaking‚Ä¶ checks the
forum‚Ä¶ only during standard job-hours.  SO, you see, THEY are the ones
that most-need the auto-help/auto-ping system.  It helps them keep
user-questions from ‚Äúfalling thru the cracks‚Äù‚Ä¶ especially on weekends
when folks HEAVILY-use BJS.  On weekends, the users need their forum
questions answered RIGHT NOW‚Ä¶ absolutely NO DELAY, because they are
‚Äúhands-on‚Äù RIGHT THEN.  An answer 4 hours from ask-time‚Ä¶ just KILLS
their workflow.  And that happens on the weekend, when every second of
BJS hands-on time‚Ä¶ is precious and rare.</p>
<p>If The Paids are intelligent‚Ä¶ they will assign a ‚Äúweekend monitor‚Äù
every weekend, all weekend long‚Ä¶ and rotate the duty between members.
Sort of like having a pager, and SOME BJS helper MUST be ‚Äúmanning the
pager‚Äù all weekend, and it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to have it monitored all night,
 too.  If they got their crap together whatsoever, this is what they
will implement.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we don‚Äôt need to babysit their priorities, but I‚Äôm not going to hold my breath.  Pffft.  What a mess.</p>

        <p>Aww hell, let‚Äôs do a bit more bashing and storytelling, here‚Ä¶ see if I can become hated MORE.</p>
<p>Ever since the start of the <a href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/the-wingnut-chronicles/97/124">Anti-Cap Rally in TWC Park</a>, I have been calling ‚Äú<a href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/the-wingnut-chronicles/97/149">The Paid Helpers</a>‚Äù‚Ä¶
 every degrading name in the book.  Dk and the 7 Dwarfs, Team
DoItForMoney, The Whores of Babylon, ‚Äúthems‚Äù, ‚Äútheys‚Äù, etc, etc.  Not
very kind, eh?</p>
<p>When I asked for the team‚Äôs name, the reply was something like
‚ÄúBabylonJS Team‚Äù.  Well, that‚Äôs not going to cut the muster, Sally. We
absolutely need a way to differentiate the ‚Äúpure‚Äù supporters, from the
‚Äúpaid‚Äù supporters.</p>
<p>After this recent discussion, trying to coax The Paids into
listening-to ideas from OUTSIDE-OF their close-knit team of cronies‚Ä¶  I
think I have decided on ‚ÄúTeam Igloo‚Äù‚Ä¶ or ‚ÄúIgloo Team‚Äù.</p>
<p>When capitalism/corporatism invaded BJS 2 years ago, capitalism
placed an ‚Äúigloo‚Äù over BJS‚Ä¶ isolating the BJS steering committee (the
paids)‚Ä¶ from the ‚Äúoutside world‚Äù.  They gathered a consortium‚Ä¶ to call
the shots, hovered around DK, their leader and chief ‚Äúpaid‚Äù.  The power
brokers‚Ä¶ isolated‚Ä¶ protected‚Ä¶ safe from outside influences and disliked
‚Äúweather‚Äù.</p>
<p>Fear not, pures!  There is a tiny opening in one end of the igloo‚Ä¶
and Team Igloo MIGHT entertain thoughts and ideas (like the GT)‚Ä¶ THRU
that little opening.  That little opening, that little crawlspace‚Ä¶ is
the community‚Äôs tiny microphone of ‚Äúhave-a-say‚Äù or ‚Äúinject a thought‚Äù.
Use it wisely, and you might get the attention of a power-broker dwarf!
 You HAVE hope!</p>
<p>Gruesome story, eh?  Could I BE a bigger prick?  Not sure. <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Yay, Igloo Team!</p>
<p>Can ya ‚Äúfeel‚Äù Deltakosh‚Äôs hands on my microphone cable?  I can.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
  I think he‚Äôs got the BIG wire-cutters in his pocket!  TWC listeners‚Ä¶
prepare for upcoming electrical blackout!  heh.  IT‚ÄôS JUST A STORY!
DON‚ÄôT FREAK OUT, please.</p>
<p>I must say, some reassurances received from Team Igloo members‚Ä¶ have
been pretty good.  I don‚Äôt know MOST of them, but SOME of them‚Ä¶ seem ok,
 so far.  Integrity seen.</p>
<p>Dk and the 7 Dwarfs.  Ya gotta admit‚Ä¶ THAT‚ÄôS funny as hell, huh?  C‚Äômon, we all know it is‚Ä¶ own-up.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Hi DK!  Happy Saturday!  Yeah, I agree.  Unfortunately, the
tags system is sort-of ignored or difficult to use, somewhat.  And you
KNOW how I ramble-on in a single post.  Sometimes I need over 200 tags
in one thread.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>But yeah, the tags system is/was an attempt at sort-by-topic.  Good point.  hmm.</p>
<p>I would also like to somehow concentrate on helping the users LEARN
the correct terms‚Ä¶ light/simple definitions.  3-4 sentences at-most, and
 then a ‚Äúclick here for docs/forum/playground/web search to learn more‚Äù
link.</p>

<p>Ah, ok.  THAT‚Äôs the info I want to know, thx.  That clears-up some
stuff.  Can we add an ‚Äúextension‚Äù to the master, NOW, and it won‚Äôt get
over-written when new master updates arrive?  If so, we can AT LEAST get
 an XML file parser activated in various places‚Ä¶ in case we DO use XML
to store the glossary/simpleDefs data.</p>
<p>Sound sane?  After every update of master‚Ä¶ would you need to
re-install our extension?  Hassle?  I don‚Äôt even know if extensions are
possible, or if a fork is required.  Sorry.  You should go enjoy your
weekend instead of answering my Discourse-noob questions.</p>

        <p>BY ME?  Do I LOOK like I cash MS‚Ä¶ ah never-mind with that joke‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not getting-thru.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I can start the glossary right now in a text editor‚Ä¶ with a
made-up-by-wingy xml markup language‚Ä¶ and use XSL to transform it into
anything, later.  (xsl can change element names, of course.  It‚Äôs like
regexp for xml!)  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I understand that the Discourse-to-XML/XSL interface might be a
little ‚Äúgray‚Äù and tough.  I don‚Äôt know what these ‚Äúplugins‚Äù are‚Ä¶ and if
they get overwritten by master-branch updates or not.  Don‚Äôt have that
info yet.  But making an XML parser plugin isn‚Äôt very difficult, one
would think.</p>
<p>But yes, in the end, we might need to fork Discourse to properly
activate our (xml?) GT system.  (auto-help?)  (AHAP?
auto-help/auto-ping?)  Keep in mind‚Ä¶ that the blog is but one of MANY
MANY possible places and ways to use the glossary.  Can ya WELD that
(fact?) into your future discussions of this?  I need you to
understand/agree‚Ä¶ that xml is possibly/likely the BEST way to store the
db.  The other steps come later.  Thoughts?</p>
<p>We could also use ideas from others, too.  We could let this topic float til maybe mid-next week‚Ä¶ see what kind of input we get.</p>

        <p>Well one thing is sure: I do not plan to maintain the forum
myself so it will stay in the hand of discourse. So if the xml/xsl idea
wants to live, we first need the plugin. But we have no idea if that
plugin will use xml/xsl to store data (I highly doubt that as I would
not have pick that support but more json probably) or even if Discourse
will be ok to do it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I agree that the glossary should be helpful elsewhere‚Ä¶like on the doc <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>JSON format is certainly an interesting thought.  Likely quite a few JSON db systems already coded.</p>
<p>Yeah, JSON has potential.  Probably MUCH faster look-up speeds, and
not too difficult to edit by hand, if ever needed.  Easy to build
add-a-term apps, even in HTML (with backside auth-in or github-like PR
staging.)</p>
<p>Yeah, json‚Ä¶ would work, I think.  (sorry for not thinking of that‚Ä¶

        <p>Okay, let‚Äôs define what a term is and when it should be
added.  (BB getting excited to jump into the epistemology/ontology
pool).<br>
Should all special commands (i.e. ArcRotateCamera, HemisphericLight,
Babylon vs BABYLON) be in the glossary, or is it limited to common
vocabulary (Scene, Camera, Light) with references to the types of each?</p>
<p>I would love to include a glossary of regularly used BJS terms in the textbook that I am writing.<br>
Each chapter starts with a vocabulary list to help students/readers, but
 thus far has been aimed at the novice (i.e. ‚ÄúObject‚Äù, ‚ÄúScene‚Äù,
‚ÄúWebGL‚Äù).<br>
As I get into the more advanced chapters, I‚Äôm happy to add more
vocabulary, but I would like it to align with the glossary idea that is
being proposed here.<br>
And yes, I agree, that the glossary should be it‚Äôs own page (and would
be great to have a intellisense feature on the site), with a link from
the FAQ (yes, I read it‚Ä¶ I accept that I‚Äôm a weirdo‚Ä¶ I also read about
the author at the beginning of the book so that I get a better idea of
the lens through which they view the world).</p>

        <p>Oh sure‚Ä¶ you start right out with all the MOST DIFFICULT to
answer questions.  Ya just come walking out onto the thread in broad
daylight‚Ä¶ buck-naked, and expect us to climb-onto some hayride that
you‚Äôre dragging behind your Massey-Fergusen farm tractor.  ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, jump
aboard, kids, we‚Äôre headed to BrainTumorville for a picnic in a horse
pasture!‚Äù</p>
<p>Then ya get us all thinking real deep, and you just drive-off and
leave us there to be eaten by thought-dilemma self-inflicted wolves.
All our guts and brains are squished into the horse-apples and muddy
tractor ruts‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ FUN hayride, Farmer Bubba!  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Too much attempted comedy with not enough results?  Yeah, it‚Äôs the story of my life.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Oh gosh‚Ä¶ the only initial thought I have‚Ä¶ is to avoid using method
names and property names‚Ä¶ as glossary entries.  Yet‚Ä¶ hmph.  That feels
like it is tying our hands.  (and might tie core programmer hands from
ever changing prop/method names - they don‚Äôt want to make the GT go
stale/need-updating)</p>
<p>Phew‚Ä¶ yeah.  I suppose a single JS db object‚Ä¶ and a ‚ÄúrecordClass‚Äù
object‚Ä¶ and perhaps even a ‚ÄúfieldClass‚Äù object.  Records hold fields, db
 holds records?</p>
<p>Like I know ANYTHING about databases.  But it would be nice‚Ä¶ if a
term‚Ä¶ could be classified.  And method/property names COULD be a
specific class of term (COT)‚Ä¶ but how useful or how much maintenance
that would take‚Ä¶ to keep that class ‚Äúfresh‚Äù?  Who knows?  Knot I, said
the rope.</p>
<p>Good usage ideas on your part, yep yep yep.  I think‚Ä¶ maybe‚Ä¶ by
Tuesday‚Ä¶ we might see much more input from wiser people.  Database Gods.
  Not sure how to start.</p>
<p>Perhaps build a terminology auto-collector engine?  Attack the old forum with it?  Good, Naz (<a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/nasimiasl">@nasimiasl</a>) is here.  He has the old forum in JSON form‚Ä¶ I think.  He‚Äôs been doing archives‚Ä¶ just in case old forum evaporates.</p>
<p>Wingy peeks-into Naz‚Äôs ‚Äúdata harvester‚Äù tractor-shed.  Smells good in
 here‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs been choppin‚Äô alfalfa, I bet.  Possibly ‚ÄúMary Jane‚Äù  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">

Data-Gleaner harvester, and bravely swallows it with a smile.)</p>

        <p>In attempt to provide structure to the chaotic hayride described by wingnut:</p>
<p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/nasimiasl">@nasimiasl</a> &amp; <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/wingnut">@Wingnut</a>, the glossary should focus on general terms and terms that are widely used but have a specific meaning in BJS.<br>
Avoiding anything that would limit the developers or require a lot of updating the future should be avoided.<br>
I like the idea of the JSON form.  Doing a quick scan of discourse plugins, there does exist <a href="https://github.com/PoloGT/abbreviation-discourse-plugin" rel="nofollow noopener">abbreviation</a>
 plugins.  There might be better tools for glossaries.  I have no idea
how easy it is to integrate a plugin into discourse when it is hosted,
but I fully appreciate <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/deltakosh">@Deltakosh</a>
 decision to let someone else do the management. There are only so many
hours in a day, let people who want to do that stuff, do it!</p>

<p>THAT statement is dangerous and limiting (imho).  One of the biggest
issues for me and other perma-noobs and easy-forgetters‚Ä¶ is geometry
terminology‚Ä¶ which is not specific to BJS.  And Math‚Ä¶ oh boy.  ‚ÄúCross‚Äù
product.  Dot product.  Magnitude.  OMG.  Not specific to BJS or 3D‚Ä¶ or
JS‚Ä¶ or HTML‚Ä¶ or‚Ä¶ sigh.  We stop at ‚Äúcanvas‚Äù‚Ä¶ when heading toward
HTML-teaching?  Probably so.</p>
<p>For Math‚Ä¶ try to quickly (Bubba‚Äôs-) ‚Äúfarm-out‚Äù the learning to approved Math web tutorials?  <em>nod</em>
  That class of terms‚Ä¶ could be called‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶ ‚Äúlight duty‚Äù?  We don‚Äôt
teach much of ANYTHING about them in the db, we farm-it out to other
pastures with minimum local overhead.  But those URLS to those other
tutorial pastures‚Ä¶ need maintenance/stale-checks.  (I hate that part).  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/nasimiasl">@nasimiasl</a>‚Ä¶
 imho‚Ä¶ feel free to move-ahead on the project as much as you wish.  Try
anything you wish, Naz.  Gather terms freely‚Ä¶ THANK YOU!</p>
<p>I can manually-filter ascii lists at SOME point, if needed. It should be done by <a href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/the-wingnut-chronicles/97/149">Igloo Team</a>,
 though.  There is no longer any reason to do voluntary work on BJS.  MS
 funds/workers are available and in-need of workload, so they can feed
their families‚Ä¶ with low risk of layoffs.  We need to help DK delegate
workload to them, to protect their families.  Igloo Team can actually
get MUCH larger and better-paid, if we ‚Äúassign‚Äù them with lots of
workload.  Efficiency dictates that we carefully/wisely utilize every
single drop of MS ‚Äújuice‚Äù draining down the feeding nipples of Igloo
Team, and try to increase that flow-rate for our Igloo-residing friends.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is best to NOT manually filter, but instead, manually ‚Äúclassify‚Äù each term.  Term-typing.</p>
<p>But‚Ä¶ we would need to establish type-categories, and I should not
make lone decisions on available term-types,  or about how a term is
type-classified.  There will likely be (a few) terms that fit MULTIPLE
term-types.  SO‚Ä¶ hmm.  Maybe db.record.type is an object with multiple
properties.  (Wingy NOT qualified for this kind of speaking - scared of
my stupidity about this subject.)  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Everyone who WANTS to participate in GT ideas/decisions‚Ä¶ SHOULD be allowed-to do so, of course.</p>
<p>We still need lots more comments, if available.  I wish to do more
web-reading about similar systems/collections, and how others/librarians
 have done things.  But, we DO need to start somewhere, gathering terms.
  The old forum has many of them.   Good idea to run some

<p>Hi John.  umm‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs easy to misword the objective, and in doing that,
 slide-into an incorrect objective mind-set.  Feel free to call it
nit-picking if you wish, but, the objective is ‚Äúcollecting‚Äù terms, and
not searching.</p>
<p>Some of the returns (from collecting terms from title lines) will be
misspelled words, but we still want them in the 1st-level returns-list.
 I suppose‚Ä¶ removal or spelling correction‚Ä¶ happens in 2nd-level
filtering stage.  (like I have a clue)  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>On the subject of TEACHING terminology to the new-to-3d folks, I
suppose the wise thing to do‚Ä¶ is to rely on WikiPedia/Wiktionary as much
 as possible.  That ‚Äúclassification of term‚Äù (COT)  (term-type) that I
mentioned earlier‚Ä¶ is probably HOW we decide <strong>IF</strong> we send ‚Äúthe click‚Äù to WikiPedia/Wiktionary/web, or <strong>IF</strong> we send the click to forum/playground/docs search-for-more-info (local resources).</p>
<p>Or perhaps we offer where-to-search choices for each term.  ie.
Search Wikipedia/Wiktionary, search web, search forum, search docs,
search playgrounds, search all‚Ä¶ buttons.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
  I dunno if we can build ‚Äúmash-ups‚Äù (transclusion) for the ‚Äúsearch all‚Äù
 returned webpage, but it‚Äôs worth a try‚Ä¶ maybe.  And I don‚Äôt know if
WikiPedia/Wiktionary returns are allowed to be inserted (embeded) into
another, larger webpage (copyright crap?).  Perhaps iFramed-in?  That‚Äôs a
 challenge for later.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Team Igloo has MONEY MONEY MONEY!  Let‚Äôs burn it up, via utilizing the workforce that it has bought for us.  YAY JOBS!</p>

        <p>Yeah.  Decisions should be done on the community side, if
allowed.  Whenever/wherever possible, workload goes to Team Igloo, to
help ensure none of them get laid-off, and to wisely utilize our MS
stipend (funding for advancing BJS).  We simply need to get DK to issue
work-orders to Team Igloo, and they‚Äôll do what they are ordered to do
(whatever community wants done).</p>
<p>The work-ordering system for Team Igloo is fairly straight-forward.
To be fair to us, DK needs to open an avenue for us to issue orders to
the workers.  There‚Äôs no reason why the community shouldn‚Äôt get to use
that MS money, too.  It‚Äôs for us, too.  Fair is fair.</p>
<p>I already saw Givo ping trevordev for a physics question from another
 user, so Givo has the right idea.  Utilize the paid workforce FIRST,
for their benefit, and for lighter workload / more play-time‚Ä¶ on the
volunteer-side.</p>

        <p>Some quick calculations:  Team Igloo harvests about 1/2 mil
USD from Microsoft, per year  (wages/insurance/training, etc), to keep

<p>We want to help Team Igloo‚Ä¶ build a bigger harvester.  The objective

        <p>Can I REALLY wander off-topic here, for a moment?</p>
<p>Let me tell you about my ultimate dream/hope.</p>
<p>I would like Microsoft‚Ä¶ in their continued leaning-towards
communalism‚Ä¶ to sponsor 10 Anti-Economy/Anti-Ownership tour buses‚Ä¶ for
me to design and manage and ‚Äúoutreach‚Äù-with.</p>
<p>But first, before i talk about the buses‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs drop a paragraph
about the new Microsoft Microphone.  It is a hand-held microphone‚Ä¶ A-2-D
 onboard‚Ä¶ wireless‚Ä¶ but it can be dis-assembled and reconfig‚Äôd in many
ways. It is very beautiful and high-tech-ish.  It‚Äôs ‚Äúcase area‚Äù has a
detachable ‚Äúhand-controller‚Äù‚Ä¶ with many many buttons‚Ä¶ maybe 4 for each
finger of a single hand.  It is about the size of a Bic lighter.  In
building this ‚Äúhidable-in-hand‚Äù controller‚Ä¶ we invent a new ‚Äúhand
controller protocol‚Äù‚Ä¶ a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù for doing single hand controlling of
MANY things.  Likely, PowerPoint controllers are already nearing this
kind of sophistication‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt know.</p>
<p>What do I do with this ‚Äúdevice‚Äù?  Trigger the playing-of sound
effects with it.  Laurel and Hardy, Red Skelton, some comedians of
present‚Ä¶ have all had EXCELLENT success‚Ä¶ doing storytelling or pantomime
 ‚Ä¶ with added sound effects.  This is for ‚Äúlive-scolding‚Äù anti-cap
preachers who speak in towns during the road show.</p>
<p>The buses‚Ä¶ are a work of wonderment.  First, they are a fold-open
stage with small-to-medium size sound system‚Ä¶ automatically wired
(speakers mounted permanently in lower storage compartments of buses.)</p>
<p>Now, about our two primary ‚Äúspeakers‚Äù‚Ä¶ a male robot called ‚ÄúBastard‚Äù
and a quick-change-personality/character LADY robot‚Ä¶ called ‚ÄúBitch‚Äù.
The primary reason to use simple Muppets-like robots to ‚Äúpreach‚Äù‚Ä¶ is to
absorb bullets from angry capitalists.  Naturally, we will also have to
check the buses for bombs, and keep the cameras and motion sensors
hopping‚Ä¶ anytime we‚Äôre doing a campground/park musical, comedic,
anti-cap rally.  These ‚Äúevents‚Äù are also ‚Äútown hall meetings‚Äù and we TRY
 to collect input from audience members‚Ä¶ so we can address those
deemed-important/pertinent concerns‚Ä¶ at future rallies.</p>
<p>We can go ‚Äúlive‚Äù‚Ä¶ in order to make fun of audience members or do
funny things like make Bastard‚Äôs head fall-off and be dangling by an
electrical cord‚Ä¶ etc.  Bastard will have a habit of flipping off (giving
 the finger)‚Ä¶ so it would be VERY funny‚Ä¶ if occasionally‚Ä¶ his hand falls
 off when trying to flip something off.</p>
<p>Bitch robot‚Ä¶ will be ‚ÄúFox News Expert‚Äù or Bastard‚Äôs wife, or
girlfriend, or prostitute‚Ä¶ priest‚Ä¶ ANYONE.  Bitch is a quick-change
Muppet-bot with many outfits, heads, etc.</p>
<p>Most of the ‚Äúsermons‚Äù with be automated.  Between shows, we might see
 Bitch and Bastard automated-dancing somewhat‚Ä¶ to the ‚Äúbreak music‚Äù.
LIVE music performance IS a possibility‚Ä¶ esp considering Wingnut knows a
 LITTLE BIT about that skill-set.</p>
<p>I would need Microsoft help to accomplish ALL OF IT‚Ä¶ from robot
armatures, to programming, to building it into nice tour buses‚Ä¶ all of
it.  I would also like each bus to look VERY happy‚Ä¶ ideally‚Ä¶ each has a
‚Äúboiler‚Äù to produce steam‚Ä¶ and has a steam whistle similar to a
Mississippi River boat‚Ä¶ announcing the arrival into YOUR town.  The bus
moves REAL slow as it heads to the park.  It is blowing steam and looks
like a cross between a circus wagon and a big corn harvester.  It plays
John Phillips Sousa music as it chugs-along, and we encourage children
to ‚Äúparade‚Äù behind the bus (and snort all them delicious bus fumes!)
(ok, not that part).</p>
<p>Can ya see it?  Can ya picture it?  Can ya afford it?  heh.  Ok, continue-on as normal‚Ä¶ Wingy ‚Äúout‚Äù (of his ever-lovin‚Äô mind)  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Update:  I see no inbound replies, so I guess everyone (active) is in agreement.  Good deal.</p>
<p>Phew‚Ä¶ did ya see that?  They tried to use a bulldozing‚Ä¶ to drag the
entire TWC park‚Ä¶ to a secluded woods outside the town-lines.  Tried to
‚Äúrelocate‚Äù the capitalism-mess clean-up team.  Gruesome!  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>SERIOUS inbound attacks!  I don‚Äôt understand why they reject the

        <p>You bet.  Besides, I have QUIT raking capitalism itself over
the coals, and have started pointing-out specific spots where the
BJS/capitalism interface‚Ä¶ is the most screwed-up and forever-lost if
something isn‚Äôt done about it RIGHT NOW.  Until we find a solve‚Ä¶ the war
 must continue.  I suggest you get Mr Gates in here‚Ä¶ to give us his
‚Äútake‚Äù on this monster-sized issue.</p>
<p>This is NOT something to ‚Äúplay games‚Äù with.  This is a serious attack
 and protection IS needed.  The community is under attack, and I‚Äôm going
 to keep trying to defend it.  I believe in BJS community.  I loved it
before it got dirty.  I MUST fight for it‚Ä¶ no matter how many sticks and
 stones you guys throw at me.</p>

<p>Hey Wingnut, you could upload it to youtube with the ‚Äúunlisted‚Äù

It‚Äôs like ‚Äúanyone with the link can view‚Äù on google docs.  Then size

        <p>Thank you, Jerome‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs very kind of you.  I play better
when not so nervous, and I sing much more projected and stoutly‚Ä¶ when
not surrounded by paper-thin walls to adjacent apartments‚Ä¶ with
neighbors who already hate me.  You play too, yes?  Mostly at-home
stuff?  Ever perform out?</p>
<p>Here, capitalism has pretty much killed the little bit of music
performing-in-public (bars).  There was SO much ordering happening from
money-desperate club owners‚Ä¶ break lengths, music types, gaps between
songs, crowd-draw, etc.  It has gotten very gestapo and full of
expectations.  Bands/performers now compete with each other for the few
performing slots that are available, instead of loving one another and
helping each other become successes‚Ä¶ like we used-to do.  Cut-throat-ism
 is rampant.</p>
<p>Now I just do donation-jug stuff and private picnics.  The tips are
often MUCH better than bar-wages, and without all the orders/fun-killing
 stuff.  Picnics/parties are still very loving and it feels like we are
playing among friends, because we are.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to hear you play/sing someday, Jerome.  Thanks for being
kind to me thru the attempted dirt-cleaning process, too.  I‚Äôm likely
headed-out‚Ä¶ removed all links to BJS from my browser start pages,
removed all notifies, etc, now.  Time to move-on to cleaner grounds, I
think.  This could be my last post.</p>
<p>If you or any others‚Ä¶ frequent/escape-to a non-corporate webGL community, drop me a mail at wingthing @ <a href="http://charter.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">charter.net</a> - perhaps I‚Äôll come-aboard.  This one is DOA.  I want to give a tip-of-the-hat to <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/gryff">@gryff</a>, too, who saw this happening LONG BEFORE I did, and left quite a while ago‚Ä¶ wisely.</p>
<p>Others:  Please, NO BJS assistance-requests to that email address, thx.  BJS-assistance requests will be ignored/gagged.</p>
<p>Jerome, thanks again for the nice comments‚Ä¶ and for the excellent
acquaintance-ship/friendship.  I learned LOTS from you (hugz)!  All of
it can transfer to a better webGL community, so none of the wisdom I
attained from you‚Ä¶ was wasted.  Not a drop of it.  Wonderful stuff!
You‚Äôre both a great programmer and a great artist‚Ä¶ and a fine
acquaintance.  Too bad the creeping ooze screwed-up the situation.</p>
<p>Too much reply, eh?  Sorry.  Note: Using all 7th chords in a country
song‚Ä¶ gives it that down-home bluesy feel.  Bayou blues‚Ä¶ taters with the
 gators‚Ä¶ south loooziana-ish crayfish pickin.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>See ya 'round, I hope.  I‚Äôll be watching for replies here for a
while, and might continue posting here, sometimes.  But they REALLY
wanna shut me up‚Ä¶ badly‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ I dunno.  I don‚Äôt have any say, here, and
they want it that way.  ‚Äúmuting‚Äù?  YIKES!  Try averting your eyes,
rocket-children.  * sigh * Just a ‚Äújunior Eichmann‚Äù festival 'round
THESE parts - controller/boss wannabes.  Sad.  Empowerments starvation.
 But money is the boss, and as long as they keep using it, it will
ALWAYS be the boss.  No empowerment for them‚Ä¶ capitalism wins.</p>

        <p>I feel that you need some temporary BJS withdraw in order to
think and inspect yourself to understand if and how you should keep on
participating or sharing things with the project and with what you feel
that the community has become (is this the record of the longest
sentence  here ?).<br>
Said differently and shortly : like everyone, you‚Äôve got your opinions,
political/philosophical/religious opinions. These opinions shape your
view of all the events in your life and of all your exchanges with the
others, like it‚Äôs the case in this forum.<br>
Actually they shape your own personality ‚Ä¶ like they do for everyone of
us. And noone is willing to renounce to what one really is.<br>
Thus, because of them (opinions), you can feel nervous, uncomfortable or
 sick because your environment (or the perception of it) changes in a
way that goes against what you feel right.</p>
<p>Well, in this case, what  would I do ?<br>
First, to ensure my own sanity, I would withdraw from the context that
causes me the discomfort or the anger. Just to let things cool down in
my mind (actually that‚Äôs what I did !).<br>
Then, once calmed down, I would not abandon for ever what has given so
much fun and joy these last years, but I would look at it from some
distance to understand what it is or what it has become really now I‚Äôm
no longer inside it. Like I would study from outside a new thing.<br>
This calm and this distance helps a lot to understand what makes us
uncomfortable or nervous.  And it helps also to understand others
motivations, behaviors and opinions.</p>
<p>Once I would have understood the reasons of my discomfort from this
external point of view and how things and people really interact when
I‚Äôm not one part of the great clockwork, I would decide if or how I
could then act back again in the system without disowning my opinions
and where, if any, I could even orientate things or people to join my
vision in some parts.<br>
That‚Äôs my way of doing. Probably not the best, but it works for me. That‚Äôs why I suggested it in my first sentence.</p>
<p>I just sincerely hope you won‚Äôt quit just because you feel nervous at
 this very moment. Just take the time to think about your decision after
 a beer, some guitar playing near a lake and having pupped your old dog.
 Of course, you‚Äôve the right to quit but people here, me first, will
then miss you so much.<br>
Even, if I also decided to not come here as often as used to in the past.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your kind words.<br>
Too bad, I‚Äôm not a musician. I started to learn music and electric piano
 only some months ago only (I like it so much : a full new universe to
discover for me). The good ones are my wife and my son, playing guitar
for some years now.</p>

        <p>Thank you, Jerome, I think that is good advice, and I will do my best to exercise those policies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately‚Ä¶ its not <em>just</em> an opinion about capitalism.  I
got the hard-evidence on the son-of-a-bitch‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve verified and
validated it numerous times.  I‚Äôve been an anti-cap activist for nearly
30 years‚Ä¶ I know that POS caste/slavery-system like the back of my hand.
  Around age 24, I set-out to determine WHY my father was SO angry SO
often.  I learned that he was being terrorized by a capitalism invention
 called ‚Äúcost-of-living‚Äù (a survival-supply blockading-system using
locks/gates called ‚Äúprice tags‚Äù)‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve been out to destroy it ever
since.</p>
<p>The BJS hayride is headed right down the center-line of Capitalism
Boulevard, and it‚Äôs stuck there.  I can TRY to somehow ‚Äúcome to
reckoning‚Äù with it, but it won‚Äôt work.  I‚Äôve tried to ‚Äúswallow‚Äù
‚Äúwaivers‚Äù and ‚Äúallowances‚Äù for it, in other aspects of my life‚Ä¶ always
failing‚Ä¶ because the hard-evidence and EASILY SEEN currently-witnessed
happenings‚Ä¶ keep blowing-apart those self-lies.</p>
<p>Truth is, capitalism is a rotten, disgusting, immoral system, and no
matter HOW I try to doctor it up with make-up and nylons and lipstick
and perfume, it‚Äôs still disgusting.  Frosting on a dog-stool !==
sweet-roll.  I‚Äôve tried the ‚Äúpaint-up‚Äù many many times, J.  It NEVER
works.  The gathered evidence and currently-seen state-of-affairs‚Ä¶
EASILY blows-off any self-lies paint-job that I try to self-fool
myself-with.  All investigated pro-capitalism stances‚Ä¶ can be EASILY
shot full of holes and its credibility collapses like wet cardboard.
Been there, done it‚Ä¶ a hundred times.</p>
<p>These kids around this forum‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt realize I‚Äôm a kick-ass
long-time capitalism investigator.  I got no creds with them, and they
are face-down in the pile of capitalism‚Äôs highly-addictive ‚Äúsnort‚Äù.
These guys aren‚Äôt going to budge from that addiction.  They got that
teddy bear hugged MUCH too tightly for any budging.  Dynamite, crowbars,
 jaws-of-life‚Ä¶ we ‚Äúcleans‚Äù are rarely able to loosen that hug.  Seen it
over and over.  They‚Äôre well-addicted to pyramiding.  Sad.
Embarrassing.  Anti-Christian to the gills.</p>
<p>Capitalism - The false-idol wars and forsake-a-thon!  YEEE HA!  Ride 'em cowboys.</p>
<p>sigh  (hug)  (I think it was a MARVELOUS well-orchestrated rally, don‚Äôt you?  Wingy self-pats.)</p>

        <p>OR‚Ä¶ not giving a crap about dying babies‚Ä¶ if it happens more
than 30 feet from your family-unto-selves pup-tent-o-competing‚Ä¶ is
blatant forsaking of fellow man‚Ä¶ and your after-life is gonna suck BIG

<p>I‚Äôm not willing to take the risk.  The dying baby is a higher

        <p>To develop a bit more about this topic (off-BJS ‚Ä¶ I know,
sorry), I can share some of your arguments, Wingy, because I read and
studied a lot about global climate warming these last months (scientific
 papers and projections).<br>
I also think it‚Äôs time to re-order some personal priorities. I still
will going to play here and there with 3D just for fun from time to
time, but I intend to dedicate now most of my time and my energy to help
 to save whatever can be at my little scale ‚Ä¶<br>
Just a matter of personal duty. I don‚Äôt want to regret later to have done nothing when it was still time.<br>
I don‚Äôt care about the money or the gratefulness. I‚Äôve got enough to live decently and don‚Äôt need more.<br>
And money can‚Äôt be eaten anyway‚Ä¶</p>
<p>About money, simply remember that if you were born the same day than
Jesus (I choose this one because he‚Äôs widely famous), if you were
immortal and if you had spent $1000  <strong>every day</strong> of your long life until today, you still wouldn‚Äôt have spent $1 billion.<br>
=&gt; 2019 x 365 x 1000 is less than 750 millions.</p>
<p>Some people (they are even more numerous each year) have dozens or
hundreds billions in their wallets. Too bad they prefer go on working
and earning even more (why ? when you‚Äôll never be able to use your money
 in a lifetime‚Ä¶ this sounds insane) rather than saving the planet with
the power of their wealth.<br>
Those are their choices.</p>
<p>I did my own at my little scale.</p>

        <p>Hey, look at YOU go.  You‚Äôre quite the labeler!  (pat pat)  Nobody can say that YOU aren‚Äôt <em>really something</em>.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre calling/labeling the earlier-proposed Team Earth‚Ä¶ ‚Äúutopia‚Äù‚Ä¶
 then I take that as a super-nice compliment, thanks!  Very kind and
wise of ya!</p>
<p>Team Earth will NOT be utopian, but instead, will take a lot of hard
work and dedication.  It will FEEL like utopia, compared to the current
warring-over money/ownership, though.</p>
<p>In general, you‚Äôll need a little more reducing impact/power than
name-calling.  The Team Earth proposal has received reducing-attempts
from ‚Äúthe best‚Äù reduction-attempters.  It‚Äôs held-up perfectly fine to
all scrutiny, so far.  ‚ÄúBad Apples‚Äù are the only real threat, and that
can be fixed‚Ä¶ in Team Earth prison-schools and thru wiser
parenting/integrity-dev.</p>
<p>The current ‚ÄúSwitch To Moneyless/Ownerless Team Earth‚Äù planning team‚Ä¶
 is looking carefully at the issue of boyfriend/girlfriend jealousies
and animosities (pee-pee tug-o-wars).  Although this problem is rampant
under capitalism, it might be substantial within Team Earth ops, too.
We could use ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET on this topic.  Current policies‚Ä¶
revolve around self-less-ness (altruism), as-defined within an OLD
‚Äúscratch document‚Äù that I authored long-ago‚Ä¶ <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/wingnutt/misc/master/rcd.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Rules for Considerate Dating</a>.</p>
<p>My advice to you:  AT LEAST use sticks and stones to attempt reductions.</p>
<p>THE BEST reducer‚Ä¶ is proving me wrong on anything I‚Äôve said, which
you won‚Äôt be able to do.  I‚Äôve been at this for too long, son.  I got
the evidence on capitalism, and it‚Äôs goin‚Äô down‚Ä¶ either with my help, or
 due to top-heavy collapsing from its own weight.</p>
<p>We ‚Äúutopians‚Äù will be laughing heartily at the collapse and carnage‚Ä¶
but us non-pyramiders are all solid Christian hippy do-gooders, and will
 help rescue and bandage the victims of the pyramid collapse.  Are ya
ready?  She‚Äôs crumbling pretty bad at the base, and lots of US-US wars
are happening‚Ä¶ between various factions near the top of the pyramid.</p>
<p>Say goodbye to it‚Ä¶ give it one last hug before it topples.  CYA,
capitalism.  There‚Äôs definitiely a slowly surging worldwide movement
seen‚Ä¶ to ‚Äútake 'er down‚Äù.  YAY!  Our competition-addicted friends are
all slowly waking-up.  We ‚Äúcleans‚Äù welcome them back from their
handed-down traditions and addiction‚Ä¶ with hugs and greetings.</p>
<p>Cooperation is the exact opposite of competing.  In the end,
cooperation will ALWAYS win, which is very strange‚Ä¶ because cooperation
doesn‚Äôt compete for wins/losses.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Perceptive investigators may have seen Wingnut recently struggle-with his friend <a class="mention" href="https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/givo">@Givo</a>‚Äôs
  robot competition.  The ‚Äútourney‚Äù was about 50-50 mix of competition
and cooperation.  THAT kind of competition is the ONLY type of
competition encouraged in Team Earth.  One must‚Ä¶ AT LEAST‚Ä¶
hope-for/push-for victory for the OTHER TEAM‚Ä¶ as much as one‚Äôs OWN team.
  Cooperative competing is odd.  Love must come first‚Ä¶ always.  Winners
should TRY to ensure that losers have AS MUCH or MORE victory
celebration fun‚Ä¶ than they (winners) themselves do.  Integrity Dev 101</p>

        <p>Aw heck, let‚Äôs talk about THE BIGGEST potential problem that COULD happen during the ‚Äúinstalling‚Äù of Team Earth ops.</p>
<p>Team Earth is a type of imperialism/empire.  Ideally, every nation,
every county, every family, every person‚Ä¶ should be-in-agreement‚Ä¶ that
Team Earth ops‚Ä¶ is the correct and more-fair way-of-operating.  Everyone
 is a member of Team Earth gov.  Everyone has a say, and each is
weighed/considered for wisdom and logic.</p>
<p>There will be no more borders and no more ownership.  Anyone can move
 into ‚Äòyour‚Äô house and use ‚Äòyour‚Äô car‚Ä¶ because Team Earth items‚Ä¶ belong
to NOBODY.  Ownership will be deemed illegal and illogical, but
‚ÄúC&amp;S‚Äù  (custodianship/stewardship) will still be in the process of
activation.  We‚Äôll quickly be inventorying/locating every single item on
 the planet‚Ä¶ adding a TE stock number to most items, and logging them
into the Team Earth supplies-division computers (the repository).
EZ-scan microchips within ID ‚Äústickers‚Äù may assist in that.</p>
<p>This part of the conversion‚Ä¶ the opening of all borders‚Ä¶ the
‚Äúimposing‚Äù of Team Earth rules/policies/wisdom upon cultures who are
perhaps not quite ready-for or accepting-of such love-one-another
policies‚Ä¶ could be a volatile-to-violence time‚Ä¶ during the conversion
attempt.</p>
<p>I think plenty of pre-planning pre-intentions discussions‚Ä¶
between/across ALL nations and cultures‚Ä¶ can ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù this potential
bump-in-the-road.  The powerful people‚Ä¶ the stars‚Ä¶ the respected ones‚Ä¶
will need to be in the streets‚Ä¶ assuring everyone that there will be
plenty for all‚Ä¶ if we all stop tug-o-warring and start adopting one
another like pets‚Ä¶ with love.  The powerful sweethearts‚Ä¶ such as Bill
Gates and Deltakosh‚Ä¶ can help us keep this potential wash-out hazard in
the roadway‚Ä¶ well-reinforced and black-topped smooth.</p>
<p>Earth materials all.  Nothing CAN be legally owned‚Ä¶ no one consulted
initial owners/creators.  Gotta cope with that fact.  Help us design the
 new C&amp;S division of Team Supplies‚Ä¶  hurry‚Ä¶ to prevent wash-out.</p>

        <p>Did you mean‚Ä¶ after the decision to proceed with Operation
Team Earth, but during the rough-water installing-problem as described
above?</p>
<p>Or what could he do to help with it‚Ä¶ right now?</p>
<p>Right now‚Ä¶ same thing as requested before.  Make sure Bill Gates
reads ‚Äúthe rally‚Äù‚Ä¶ including most-recent posts.  Then see if we can get
an understanding/agreement of/to mymymy claims, and try to get the
‚Äúhands off BJS‚Äù promise for DK and the 7 Dwarfs.</p>
<p>Then, learn from Mr Gates‚Ä¶ HOW CLOSE MS is‚Ä¶ to going ‚Äúmore commune‚Äù‚Ä¶ and then hope-for the 10 tour-buses dream to come true.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
  AND‚Ä¶ give Mr.Gates/MS the MS Microphone idea and let him run-with-it
as-if HE invented it.  (I don‚Äôt claim ownership, for the most-part,
duh.)</p>
<p>But DK already told me in PM‚Ä¶ that he has little/no contact with Mr.
Gates, and DK didn‚Äôt sound overly-excited to SEEK contact with Mr.
Gates. DK suggested contacting ‚ÄúBill‚Äù via the Gates Foundation.  When I
emailed Mr. Glen Weyl‚Ä¶ who is a Microsoft-sponsored ‚Äúwe need to change
our economy/ownership system‚Äù book-tour guy‚Ä¶ giving him the address to
our rally, and a few other friendly words‚Ä¶  I CC‚Äôd to bill.gates at ms
foundation.  Bill and Glen have been given the opportunity to read-along
 and make a comment if they wish-to.  We welcome it.  I hope he/they are
 lurking with us‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd LOVE to meet him/them‚Ä¶ and talk for a few minutes.
  (sigh) (drool).</p>
<p>I wouldn‚Äôt mind meeting DK and other igloos and non-igloos, too‚Ä¶ but I
 cannot afford the trip or hotels involved in getting there.</p>
<p>AND‚Ä¶ to ‚Äúvote on‚Äù get-togethers in front of poor people and third
world country people who haven‚Äôt the opportunity to visit ‚Äúthe picnic‚Äù‚Ä¶
is disgusting decadence.  Ya‚Äôll should be ashamed of yourselves for
doing that.</p>

        <p>Deltakosh is actually very close-to Bill Gates‚Ä¶ without knowing it.</p>
<p>First‚Ä¶ they both appear to be sweethearts‚Ä¶ so an easy friendship
between the two‚Ä¶ is ALMOST guaranteed‚Ä¶ should the oppor-tuna-casserole
ever present itself.</p>
<p>BJS‚Ä¶ is actually the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> ‚Äúseed‚Äù (I‚Äôm
using Givo-talk, here)‚Ä¶ and MS is likely to be going BERSERK for 3d‚Ä¶ at
any moment.  Again, they will have a HUGE market in AR sunglasses and
stick-on solar-power AR transceivers that we stick to everything on the
entire planet‚Ä¶ to make our MS AR Sunglasses‚Ä¶ ‚Äúcome alive‚Äù (when AR
transceiver-items are in-view).  Anyway, that‚Äôs later.  BJS will be used
 for that.</p>
<p>But here‚Äôs the important thing.  Bill Gates still ‚Äúgot game‚Äù‚Ä¶ and we
WANT him involved in the new 3D surge‚Ä¶ cuz he‚Äôs an excellent ‚Äúidea guy‚Äù‚Ä¶
 always HAS been.  So, whether he‚Äôs retired or not‚Ä¶ we need his brains‚Ä¶
and ESP his heart‚Ä¶ as we commune-up.  I hope Bill will help me and other
 team members‚Ä¶ work on our 10 buses and the substantial robots control
systems involved in each one.  YUM!  (droooooooool)</p>
<p>This is also why I drool over ‚ÄúHouse on the Rock‚Äù in Spring Green
Wisconsin.  It is a anima-pneumatics wonderland, which needs converting
to anima-tronics.  I would LOVE for House on the Rock (HOR)‚Ä¶ to be
purchased by Microsoft‚Ä¶ and given as a gift/classroom‚Ä¶ to the University
 of Wisconsin Robotics division‚Ä¶ but shared by all other robotics
programs worldwide, as well.  UW just ‚Äúcustodians‚Äù it.  If you‚Äôve never
been to House on the Rock‚Ä¶ GO.  It‚Äôll take all day to see SOME of it.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/wink.png" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  Prepare for high-drooling.</p>
<p>Yep‚Ä¶ Bill and DK‚Ä¶ easily good friends and useful partners as we wander into the soon-to-be-supercharged era of 3D.  YAY!</p>

        <p>Hi gang.  Here‚Äôs another warning about a subject‚Ä¶ that Jerome
 pointed-out to me in PM, once upon a time.  I will restate it here,
without his permission.  (He is very forgiving of such things, and is
deeply-smart‚Ä¶ on multiple ‚Äúfacets‚Äù.  I‚Äôm proud and honored to know him a
 tiny bit.)</p>
<p>Hey Jerome‚Ä¶ wha-da-ya-think of the name UVs?  Union of Volunteers.</p>
<p>UV‚Äôs vs. The Igloo‚Ä¶ The Melting!  (a movie?)  Anywhy‚Ä¶ back on-subject‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The definitions‚Ä¶ of terms/phrases like ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù and ‚Äúour friends‚Äù
and ‚Äúthe public‚Äù‚Ä¶ are MUCH different  inside Team Igloo. (Much different
 from defs we ‚Äúcleans‚Äù are expecting/assuming.)</p>
<p>Inside the igloo, ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù includes ‚Äúbusiness partners‚Äù.  Golf,
fine dining, resort vacations, theater tickets, and other ‚Äúschmoozing
activities‚Äù MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED between DK/7D‚Ä¶ and these ‚Äúbizzyness
partners‚Äù.  Yikes!  The entire Igloo Team‚Ä¶ is subject-to these
‚Äúschmooze-influences‚Äù.</p>
<p>So, when DK or another MS-employed-for-BJS‚Ä¶ says something like ‚Äúthe
community requested that change‚Äù‚Ä¶ it COULD mean‚Ä¶ ‚Äúone of our
corporate/bizzyness partners requested that change‚Äù.</p>
<p>Pures/volunteers‚Ä¶ watch-out for those definition distortions.  You‚Äôve
 been warned.  It is almost sure to happen.  Watch for MANY other
distorted definitions/assumed-meanings‚Ä¶ as well.  ‚ÄúBusiness partners‚Äù
are VERY powerful influences over/for Team Igloo.</p>
<p>Busyness partners will get the most say/power of ANY ‚Äúcommunity
member‚Äù.  This happens, likely, simply from old, stale‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbiz-habits‚Äù and
 via yet another kind of forsaking of the little guy‚Ä¶ by money.</p>
<p>As they say, ‚Äúmoney talks, ants get squished.‚Äù</p>
<p>Errr‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not quite how the adage goes‚Ä¶ but it is similar.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Wingy out.</p>

        <p>Entrenchment:  Wouldn‚Äôt it be interesting‚Ä¶ to know the hire-dates of all Team Igloo members?</p>
<p>I wonder if the NEWEST members‚Ä¶ are the ones most-pushing for a meet-up.</p>
<p>It is likely that the newest members‚Ä¶ want to ‚Äúentrench‚Äù‚Ä¶ for max
job-security.  So they would be the ones most likely to TRY to
‚Äúbefriend‚Äù DK and his wife and daughter‚Ä¶ to ‚Äúget personal‚Äù‚Ä¶ possibly be
called ‚ÄúUncle <em>Whatever</em>‚Äù by DK‚Äôs daughter.  ‚Äúfamiliar (family-ar) affection‚Äù‚Ä¶ good entrenchment tactic.</p>
<p>But DK‚Ä¶ needs to keep the dwarfs ‚Äúat arms length‚Äù, in case he needs to fire/terminate them, later.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a real interesting situation.  Jockeying and entrenching - another type of ‚Äúschmooze-influencing‚Äù.</p>
<p>Essentially, a great compete-to-entrench ‚Äúpuppet show‚Äù will likely
happen‚Ä¶ for DK‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs affection and for DK‚Äôs wife‚Äôs approval (at
the meetup).  It should be a pretty good show.  I hope we get it on
video.</p>

        <p>Didja notice‚Ä¶ that the meet-up‚Ä¶ was ‚Äúmixed-with‚Äù Q/A (questions and answers)?</p>
<p>Do you see how this ‚Äúassumes‚Äù that Dk/7d are somehow ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù about the ‚Äústeering‚Äù of BJS?</p>
<p>But really, the UV‚Äôs (Union of Volunteers) are THE authority on the
community.  Many of us have been involved in BJS much longer than the
paid dwarfs.  So, the UV‚Äôs are the authority at the meet-up, and
community-wide.  The dwarfs have the potential of being driven-by-cash,
and thus‚Ä¶ will be required-to earn‚Äôn‚Äôdeserve the right (for MORE
time-span than required-of a UV)‚Ä¶ to be positioned as authority figures.
  They‚Äôre just too new‚Ä¶ and too untested.  Not yet much trust
earned‚Äôn‚Äôdeserved.  They are much too ‚Äúbroke‚Äù in THAT dept‚Ä¶ to do much
trust ‚Äúaffording‚Äù.  It‚Äôs nothing personal.  Capitalism participants have
 been seen being totally decadent and disgusting WORLDWIDE‚Ä¶ and Team
Igloo has to counter-battle that bad reputation.  That‚Äôs just the way it
 is, and the way it has to be, and the way it will stay‚Ä¶ sorry gang.
Competers_church.org has a TERRIBLE reputation, world-wide.  Not my
fault.</p>
<p>Q/A?  You bet.  It is a chance for Team Igloo to ask us
well-experienced and well-respected UV‚Äôs‚Ä¶ about the expected integrity
and etiquette that MUST be exercised/maintained in BJS-land.  It is a
chance for the dwarfs‚Ä¶ to find out what is expected of them‚Ä¶ especially
morals-wise.  They WILL exercise the quality of integrity that has been
WELL-ESTABLISHED around here for 5+ years‚Ä¶ OR ELSE the UV‚Äôs are going to
 fire/terminate them.</p>
<p>DOES the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù (the REAL community‚Ä¶ the UV‚Äôs)‚Ä¶ have ‚Äúthe say‚Äù to ban/fire a paid dwarf?</p>
<p>We SHOULD, if this is a fair community.</p>
<p>UV‚Äôs‚Ä¶ DO NOT ‚Äúhand-over your power‚Äù to a Team Igloo member‚Ä¶ before
you have THOROUGHLY examined their intestinal fortitude (integrity,
morals, honesty, clear-thinking, cap-influencings, etc.)  Push the
integrity measuring-stick‚Ä¶ down their throats, into their ears and
noses, up their butts, into any other available holes, and study your
findings‚Ä¶ VERY carefully.  Feel free to seriously interrogate them‚Ä¶
whenever you get the chance.  Try to get a morals-compass reading on
each one, and don‚Äôt be fooled by fake readings and/or ‚Äúlip-service‚Äù.
NEVER lower/remove a ‚Äúwatch 'em camera‚Äù‚Ä¶ just because one of them TELLS
you ‚Äúthey care‚Äù (like the PR video tried).</p>
<p>All in all, cleans‚Ä¶ keep FULL cameras and spying active on ALL paids‚Ä¶
 for at least 3 years, or until they can be trusted‚Ä¶ by proving
themselves worthy of holding-onto integrity.  Watch every single move
they make‚Ä¶ and be ON THEIR ASSES about morals/integrity‚Ä¶ CONTINUOUSLY.</p>
<p>Again, no accusations‚Ä¶ but they were stupid enough to join
capitalism, so they could EASILY be stupid enough to ATTEMPT all sorts
of slimy maneuvers.  (okay, okay, maybe they were FORCED to join
capitalism, I wouldn‚Äôt know, not without further investigation.)  Watch
'em, cleans/pures.  Watch 'em carefully.  They‚Äôll appreciate all that
loving attention.</p>
<p>Again, again, again, and once more‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm NOT making any accusations.
But the capitalism-driven ‚Äúframework‚Äù that was formed 2 years ago‚Ä¶ is
HIGHLY conducive to all sorts of shyster-ism.  Cover your asses, cleans!
  Watch 'em.</p>
<p>I really wish I could take a break from having to do all these
warnings.  I could use some help from fellow UV‚Äôs‚Ä¶ pointing-out the
plethora of trouble-spots that Team Igloo has caused.  But I suppose‚Ä¶
not many UV‚Äôs are trained in cap-control ops‚Ä¶ as much as I am.</p>
<p>Watch 'em closely.  Wear a helmet‚Ä¶ they are POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS!  SOME have shown <em>some</em>
 integrity‚Ä¶ but only introductory-level integrity.  They got 3-4 more
years of proving themselves worthy of being members of our community,
and ESPECIALLY being members of the steering committee (Team Igloo).  DK
 does NOT have the time or facilities to meticulously screen and vet
(investigate/scrutinize) the dwarfs.  We UV‚Äôs MUST do it with our
cameras and our spying-for-good‚Äôn‚Äôright-ness.</p>
<p>Look around.  We have a MASSIVE troop of UV‚Äôs who have proven their
wisdom and integrity FOR YEARS!  THESE people are OUR ‚Äústeering
committee‚Äù, and they are MUCH MORE proven and trustworthy then the
dwarfs of Team Igloo.  ONLY hand-away your power/decision-making‚Ä¶ to
PROVEN authorities, and it might be wise to ‚ÄúStay UV-ONLY‚Äù for a while‚Ä¶
while the dwarfs attempt to prove themselves worthy-of authority
positions‚Ä¶ for 3+ years.  Be wise, UV‚Äôs.</p>
<p>They‚Äôre probably wanting to ‚Äúhold/throw‚Äù this meet-up‚Ä¶ near their
familiar war-grounds of Redmond.  They (Team Igloo underlings/dwarfs)
will likely be trying to get wives/kids to become best-friends with
other wives/kids (entrenchment ops).  We UV‚Äôs are behind-the-8-ball,
affordability-wise, and will likely have low-attendance due to this
cost-of-living-brand money-rationing (spoken-of earlier).</p>
<p>The Redmond Dwarfs don‚Äôt need to deal with this.  They are (likely)
in-town, a few miles from the meet-up, at-most.  This is why they can
‚Äúafford‚Äù to bring family members, too.  It‚Äôs REALLY more of a BJS Inc.
corporate picnic, at least in THEIR eyes/attitude.</p>
<p>So, they are likely to TRY a ‚Äúrailroading‚Äù‚Ä¶ attempting to place
themselves into the authority or ‚Äústar‚Äù roles (via
positional-jockeying).  Even if only a few of us UV‚Äôs manage to attend‚Ä¶
PLEASE TRY to remove the dwarfs from all attempted authority-role
self-emplacements.  Don‚Äôt be afraid AT ALL‚Ä¶ of ‚Äútaking them down off
their high-horses‚Äù.  They are capitalists.  They will TRY, by pure
programming/habit‚Ä¶ to gather empowerment and entrenchment (often via
family-ar schmoozing ops, but ALSO, OFTEN, by positional-jockeying and
assuming authority roles without warrant/justification/investigation).</p>
<p>UV‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it is illegal to use baseball bats to de-throne ‚Äúiggs‚Äù from
their deluded power-trips (if seen/found).  You‚Äôll need to use a
different method to take them down, and put them in their proper (earned
 and deserved) place.  UV‚Äôs‚Ä¶ please DO NOT use ANY violence AT ALL‚Ä¶ for
de-powering a head-strong dwarf or dwarf-sympathizer.  That is NOT the
good‚Äôn‚Äôright way to return a head-in-the-clouds empowerment junkie‚Ä¶ back
 to Earth/ground/egalitarian levels.</p>
<p>Remember that caps are often ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù or ‚Äústoned‚Äù on money/empowerment
 ‚Äúsnort‚Äù.  Be loving to them‚Ä¶ they often know-not what they joined,
know-not what they have morally-condoned, know-not what they were handed
 by their parents/kin, and know-not what they
hand-down-as-traditions/values to THEIR kids.  The lost‚Ä¶ are STILL worth
 hugging and caring-for.  They CAN be rescued.</p>
<p>Wingy out‚Ä¶ probably about to be censored again.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  I just learned that these ‚Äúmeet-ups‚Äù are often
coding/programming-based, and NOT a picnic where one might bring kin or
grill burgers or toss frisbees.  My mistake.</p>

<p>It is time, I think, for you to take the light of your message and
form a BabylonJS community of your own, along the lines you want. Since
BJS is open source and given the general level of expertise there must
be among users other than the core team it must be perfectly possible,
with enough interest, to set up a fork and develop an alternative
breakaway group.</p>
<p>As I have been reading your message and there is nothing you can say
to change my mind it is with sadness I now add you as the first on my
ignore list.</p>

        <p>Yay John, freely exercising his right to look-away.  Ya can‚Äôt ask for better than that, eh?  Freedom is good.</p>
<p>Most look-aways simply don‚Äôt click on the TWC icon‚Ä¶ but whatever

<p>Save 100,000 babies‚Ä¶ OR make John King and 4 of his ego-centric likers‚Ä¶ happy ?  hmm.</p>

        <p>Ok‚Ä¶ we got some real weak news on a fuzzy radio transmission‚Ä¶
 from the peace talks.  There is SOME indications‚Ä¶ that the Chief of
Team Igloo‚Ä¶ MIGHT come to the negotiating table.  There‚Äôs been <em>some</em> back-room discussions‚Ä¶ that have been fruitful (at least in OUR UV opinion).</p>
<p>Naturally we UV‚Äôs will still have some ‚Äúrequirements‚Äù needing to be
met‚Ä¶ before any armistice can be agreed-upon.  We‚Äôre going to be calling
 for NO MORE ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù from Team Igloo.  It has not been
carefully defined as-to WHAT ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù IS‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ current
thinking‚Ä¶ if you see it ANYWHERE within the BJS cow-moo-nity‚Ä¶ you can
shoot it.  ALRIGHT!  <img src="twc8_e2_files/smiley_002.png" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Sigh.  Ok, last tip for UV‚Äôs‚Ä¶ hopefully.  Spying.</p>
<p>I propose a ‚Äúspy-der‚Äù app that keeps an eye on all paid dwarfs,
called Santa Claws (very sharp claws, btw).  It monitors all paids‚Ä¶
everything they say, everything they touch, and tells us UV‚Äôs when
they‚Äôve been naughty, and when they‚Äôve been nice.  <img src="twc8_e2_files/wink.png" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Perhaps too imposing a system‚Ä¶ to propose at the negotiating table (if one happens).  <img src="twc8_e2_files/slight_smile_002.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Just like my friend Assange‚Ä¶ we UV‚Äôs KNOW that the WhiteHouse ( The
Igloo )‚Ä¶ is wiki-leaky.  Try to get the dwarfs to engage in
conversation‚Ä¶ spill their beans about ANY Team Igloo projects that THEY
are currently excited-about.  Inside that blabbering‚Ä¶ is GOLD!</p>
<p>UV‚Äôs can learn about MANY ‚Äúsecret‚Äù happenings inside the Igloo‚Ä¶ with
leak-watching.  It may be your ONLY source of unbiased/clean news‚Ä¶ from
inside the WhiteHouse igloo.  Disseminate ANY leaked data you can‚Ä¶ ALL
OVER THE FORUM.  Hand it out to EVERYONE who is willing to publish it.
Get ‚Äúthe word‚Äù out there‚Ä¶ full sprinkler systems.  And OF COURSE, pass
it to the underground.</p>
<p>Also TRY to determine WHO and WHAT is a ‚Äúbusiness partner‚Äù‚Ä¶ ALWAYS.
When you discover one‚Ä¶ ya GOTTA do an integrity check on ALL members of
that ‚Äúpoint of BJS contact‚Äù‚Ä¶  full blown.  Check 'em up the butt, down
the throat, ears-noses-more‚Ä¶ get morals-compass reading on them.
Remember that they are CAP‚Ä¶ which means 3+ years of vetting-time‚Ä¶ before
 they are to be fully trusted for having intestinal fortitude (required
for authority/tribal-elder roles).</p>
<p>Also remember that caps DO NOT check integrity AT ALL‚Ä¶ before making
bizzyness ‚Äúdeals‚Äù with bizzyness partners.  NOT A BIT!  They‚Äôll
‚Äúbuy-into‚Äù ANYTHING‚Ä¶ due to lack of investigation/vetting.  Watch 'em.
Fully broadcast/pass-along all reputational metadata‚Ä¶ regarding
bizzyness contacts who have made ‚Äúdeals‚Äù with Team Igloo.  If they
refuse to expose/go-transparent‚Ä¶ CAN 'em, dissolve the contact, they
aren‚Äôt trustworthy.  NEVER trust a non-transparent bizzyness
partner/contact.</p>
<p>Hopefully, there will be more talk-of WHAT ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù IS‚Ä¶
soon.  We UV‚Äôs are hoping to get our fair rights back‚Ä¶ and that is SUPER
 good news.  Keep in mind‚Ä¶ THEY invaded us, and we DID NOT invade them.
 BUT‚Ä¶ it appears that it MIGHT have been ‚Äúan occupation‚Äù that they
ASSUMED nobody would ‚Äúmind‚Äù, but they were mistaken.  (an unintentional
invasion ‚Ä¶ possibly a poorly transmitted ‚Äúannouncing an occupation‚Äù
news-source, and definitely a lack of voting to allow/dis-allow
capitalism fundamentalists to enter/occupy BJS lands.)</p>
<p>Party on!  (fingers crossed)</p>
